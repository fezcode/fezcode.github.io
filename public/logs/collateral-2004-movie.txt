## About

**Collateral (2004)** is an American neo-noir action thriller film directed by Michael Mann and written by Stuart Beattie. The film stars Tom Cruise as Vincent, a meticulous and ruthless contract killer, and Jamie Foxx as Max Durocher, a mild-mannered Los Angeles taxi driver. On one fateful night, Max's ordinary shift turns into a nightmare when Vincent forces him to drive him around the city to complete a series of five assassination targets before dawn.

As the night progresses, Max finds himself increasingly entangled in Vincent's deadly world, forced to confront his own fears and limitations. The film is renowned for its intense, character-driven narrative, its stylish and atmospheric portrayal of the Los Angeles cityscape at night (often shot on digital video to capture its unique look), and its exploration of themes like chance, fate, and the unexpected connections between strangers. It features powerful performances from its lead actors, with Cruise delivering a chillingly effective villain and Foxx earning an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor.

## My Thoughts

Michael Mann's *Collateral* is a masterclass in tension and atmosphere, a film that thrives on its nocturnal energy and the electrifying dynamic between its two leads. Tom Cruise delivers one of his most compelling performances as Vincent, a silver-haired, morally detached professional killer who is both terrifyingly efficient and surprisingly philosophical. He's not just a villain; he's a force of nature, and Cruise embodies him with a chilling precision.

Jamie Foxx's portrayal of Max is equally brilliant, a man pushed far beyond his comfort zone, forced to find a courage he never knew he possessed. Their conversations, often profound and surprisingly intimate amidst the violence, form the backbone of the film. Mann's direction is iconic, bathing Los Angeles in a hyper-realistic, neon-soaked glow that turns the city itself into a character. The action sequences are brutal and precise, but it's the quiet moments of existential dread and burgeoning defiance that truly make this film sing.

The jazz club scene, the intense dialogue, the relentless pacing – it all combines to create an unforgettable "vibe movie" (as the user puts it). *Collateral* is a lean, mean, and utterly engrossing thriller that showcases Mann at the top of his game, delivering a film that's as intellectually stimulating as it is pulse-pounding. A definitive neo-noir classic.
