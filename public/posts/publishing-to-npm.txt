# How to Publish a Node.js Library to npm

This document outlines the steps taken to publish the `piml.js` library to the npm registry.

## 1. Initial Setup and Conversion

-   Creating a `piml.js` file to house the JavaScript library.
-   Creating a `piml.test.js` file to test the JavaScript library.

## 2. Setting up the Node.js Project

To prepare the project for npm, the following steps were taken:

-   **`package.json`:** A `package.json` file was created to manage the project's metadata and dependencies. It was populated with the following information:
    -   `name`: The name of the package on npm (e.g., "piml").
    -   `version`: The initial version of the package (e.g., "1.0.0").
    -   `description`: A brief description of the package.
    -   `main`: The entry point of the package (e.g., "piml.js").
    -   `scripts`: A "test" script to run the tests using Jest.
    -   `keywords`: Keywords to help users find the package on npm.
    -   `author`: The author of the package.
    -   `license`: The license of the package (e.g., "MIT").
    -   `devDependencies`: The development dependencies, such as `jest`.

-   **`.gitignore`:** A `.gitignore` file was created to prevent unnecessary files from being committed to the repository, such as `node_modules`, logs, and system files.

-   **Dependencies Installation:** The development dependencies were installed by running `npm install`.

## 3. Testing

With the project set up, the tests were run to ensure the library was working correctly:

```bash
npm test
```

Any failing tests were debugged and fixed until all tests passed.

## 4. Publishing to npm

Once the library was tested and ready, the following steps were taken to publish it to npm:

1.  **Create an npm Account:** An npm account is required to publish packages. You can create one at [https://www.npmjs.com/signup](https://www.npmjs.com/signup).

2.  **Log in to npm:** From the command line, you need to log in to your npm account:

    ```bash
    npm login
    ```

    You will be prompted to enter your npm username, password, and email address.

3.  **Check Package Name Availability:** Before publishing, it's a good practice to check if the desired package name is available. This can be done by running:

    ```bash
    npm view <package-name>
    ```

    If the package exists, you will see information about it. If it doesn't, you will get a 404 error, which means the name is available.

4.  **Publish the Package:** To publish the package, run the following command from the project's root directory:

    ```bash
    npm publish
    ```

    If the package name is scoped (e.g., `@username/package-name`), you need to use the `--access public` flag:

    ```bash
    npm publish --access public
    ```

5.  **Verify the Package:** After publishing, you can verify that the package is available on npm by visiting `https://www.npmjs.com/package/<your-package-name>`.

By following these steps, the `piml.js` library was successfully published to the npm registry.
