## About "Common Side Effects"

"Common [Side Effects](/#/vocab/side-effects)" is an adult animated sci-fi comedy created by Joe Bennett and Steve Hely,
and executive produced by Mike Judge and Greg Daniels.

The series follows Marshall and Frances, two former high school lab partners who stumble upon a rare mushroom that holds
the key to curing all the world's diseases. However, they soon find themselves entangled in a massive conspiracy as
"Big Pharma" and the government will stop at nothing to suppress the discovery.

It blends the sharp, satirical wit of *King of the Hill* with a trippy, psychedelic visual style that feels right at home on Adult Swim.
The show tackles themes of corporate greed and the ethics of healthcare with a healthy dose of humor and heart.
