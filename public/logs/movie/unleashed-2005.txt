Unleashed (2005)

Unleashed (also known as Danny the Dog) is a 2005 martial arts action thriller film directed by Louis Leterrier, written by Luc Besson, and starring Jet Li, Morgan Freeman, and Bob Hoskins.

The film follows Danny (Jet Li), a man who has been raised like a dog and trained to kill by his "master," a ruthless mobster named Bart (Bob Hoskins). Danny wears a collar and is only released to fight. After a car crash leaves Bart for dead, Danny escapes and is taken in by a kind, blind piano tuner named Sam (Morgan Freeman) and his stepdaughter Victoria. Through them, Danny begins to discover his humanity and his passion for music. However, his past eventually catches up with him.

It's a unique blend of high-octane martial arts choreography (by Yuen Woo-ping) and a surprisingly touching emotional core. Jet Li gives one of his best dramatic performances here.
