An entertaining crime thriller with mediocre characters. It had some (_dark_) comedy moments.
The environment, **The City** is a part of the story, it acts as a side character through out the whole movie.

In a way, we witness our main character's, played by [Austin Butler](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2581521), rite of passage, becoming a man. With every step he takes, he gets himselft into more trouble and _somehow_ (eventually) he takes the right (right in the context of the movie of course) steps to fix them. A Clear Conscience... Can he have that...

Also that British accent, ***chef's kiss***
