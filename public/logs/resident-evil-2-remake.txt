## About

**Resident Evil 2: Remake** is a survival horror game developed and published by Capcom. Released in January 2019, it is a complete remake of the 1998 classic, *Resident Evil 2*. The remake was built from the ground up, utilizing Capcom's proprietary RE Engine to deliver stunning photorealistic graphics, a new over-the-shoulder camera perspective, modernized controls, and a more immersive, terrifying experience while remaining faithful to the original's narrative and iconic moments.

The game is set in Raccoon City, a Midwestern American town that has been devastated by a viral outbreak. Players choose to play as either rookie police officer Leon S. Kennedy or college student Claire Redfield, each with their own distinct campaigns and story paths. Both protagonists find themselves trapped in the zombie-infested Raccoon City Police Department and must navigate through gruesome hordes of undead, mutated creatures, and solve intricate puzzles to escape the city and uncover the truth behind the Umbrella Corporation's involvement.

A standout feature is the relentless pursuit by the Tyrant (Mr. X), a nearly indestructible bio-organic weapon that stalks players throughout large sections of the game, creating constant tension and jump scares. The gameplay emphasizes resource management, exploration, and combat, striking a perfect balance between action and classic survival horror elements. It was universally praised for its atmosphere, graphics, and faithful yet fresh take on a beloved title.
