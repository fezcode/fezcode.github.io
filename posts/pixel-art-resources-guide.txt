### Quick Tips for Beginners
1. **Start Small:** Don't try to draw a massive 256x256 piece right away. Start with 16x16 or 32x32.
2. **Limit Your Palette:** Using too many colors can make your art look messy. Stick to 4-8 colors initially.
3. **Study Real Life:** Even though it's stylized, good pixel art is often grounded in real-world lighting and anatomy.
4. **Practice Your Lines:** Learn about "jaggies" and how to avoid them to keep your lines looking clean and intentional.

Pixel art is as much about what you leave out as what you put in. Happy pixeling!
