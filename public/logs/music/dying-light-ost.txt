# Dying Light Original Soundtrack

The original soundtrack for the 2015 survival horror hit **Dying Light**, composed by the legendary Polish composer **Pawel Blaszczak**.

## About Pawel Blaszczak

Pawel Blaszczak is a renowned Polish video game music composer who has been active in the industry since 1997. He is best known for his work with **Techland**, where he served as Sound Director for many years. 

His impressive portfolio includes:
- **Call of Juarez** series
- **Dead Island**
- **The Witcher** (collaborated with Adam Skorupa, winning an IGN Award for Best Soundtrack in 2007)
- **Dying Light 2: Stay Human** (Sound Director/Composer)

Blaszczak's approach to the *Dying Light* OST was unique. Instead of typical horror tropes, he drew inspiration from **1970s and 1980s film soundtracks**. He utilized synthesizers to create a melancholic, abandoned atmosphere that perfectly captures the "post-apocalyptic" despair and the terrifying silence of the night in Harran.

## Atmospheric Highlights

The soundtrack is famous for its transition between the rhythmic, synth-heavy daytime tracks and the ambient, tension-filled nighttime themes.

## Final Thoughts

It is truly one of the best video game OSTs out there. It doesn't just provide background noise; it defines the identity of the game. The way it fits the atmosphere is nothing short of perfect.
