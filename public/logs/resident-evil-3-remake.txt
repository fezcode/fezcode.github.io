## About

**Resident Evil 3: Remake** is a survival horror game developed and published by Capcom. Released in April 2020, it is a reimagining of the 1999 PlayStation classic, *Resident Evil 3: Nemesis*. The remake modernizes the game with contemporary graphics and controls, while narrating the harrowing escape of Jill Valentine from Raccoon City during a zombie apocalypse, all while being relentlessly pursued by the unstoppable bio-organic weapon, Nemesis.

The story runs concurrently with *Resident Evil 2*, focusing on S.T.A.R.S. operative Jill Valentine's desperate struggle to survive in a city overrun by the T-virus. Her primary antagonist is Nemesis, a highly intelligent and resilient creature designed by Umbrella Corporation to eliminate surviving S.T.A.R.S. members. The game emphasizes action over strict survival horror, featuring more combat encounters and a faster pace than its predecessor.

Gameplay mechanics include the over-the-shoulder third-person perspective seen in *Resident Evil 2 Remake*, with refined gunplay and movement. A new "perfect dodge" mechanic allows players to evade enemy attacks with precise timing, rewarding them with an opportunity to counter-attack. The game also features environmental destructibility and dynamic encounters with Nemesis, ensuring constant pressure and unpredictability. While it generally received positive reviews for its graphics and gameplay, some criticism was directed at its shorter campaign and linearity compared to the original.

## My Thoughts

*Resident Evil 3: Remake* is a solid, albeit somewhat contentious, entry in Capcom's series of remakes. Visually, it's stunning, bringing the ravaged Raccoon City to life with incredible detail and atmospheric lighting. The updated controls and fluid combat make for a very enjoyable action experience, especially when dealing with the hordes of zombies and other creatures. The "perfect dodge" is a fantastic addition, adding a layer of skill and satisfaction to combat encounters.

The star of the show, as always, is Nemesis. His relentless pursuit creates a constant sense of urgency and terror, making every encounter with him a heart-pounding event. The updated design for Nemesis is truly imposing, and his ability to dynamically appear in different locations keeps you on edge.

However, where the game falters slightly is in its faithfulness to the original's scope. While the narrative is well-paced and engaging, it condenses or outright removes certain iconic locations and puzzles from the 1999 game. This results in a much shorter and more linear experience, which might disappoint fans looking for the expansive exploration of the original. Despite this, the game is still a thrilling ride, a great survival horror action game, and a worthy addition to the Resident Evil canon. It just doesn't quite reach the heights of *Resident Evil 2 Remake* or *Resident Evil 4 Remake* in terms of content and reimaginative scope.
