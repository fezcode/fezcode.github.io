    "description": "\"The Stranger\" by Albert Camus is an absurdist masterpiece exploring humanity's search for meaning against an indifferent universe. It follows Meursault, a detached Frenchman condemned for his emotional apathy rather than his crime, who ultimately finds freedom in accepting the \"benign indifference\" of existence. The novel critiques societal judgment and advocates for embracing the absurd with conscious defiance."

    "description": "Osamu Dazai's \"The Flowers of Buffoonery\" is a darkly humorous novel set in a seaside sanitarium, where Yozo Oba and his visitors adopt a clownish facade while grappling with youth, love, self-hatred, and depression. It offers a poignant glimpse into prewar Japan's outsiders, showcasing Dazai's exploration of dark human emotions through a blend of humor and sadness."
