    (title) Knowledge Graph Visualization Protocol
    (description)
      A visual 'brain' for Fezcodex. Every single blog post, app, and log is a node in a 3D interactive map.
      Nodes are connected by shared tags (e.g., 'React' or 'Horror'). Users can spin, zoom, and click nodes to travel
      through the site's logic instead of using standard menus.

    (title) Windowed Workspace Environment
    (description)
      A 'Desktop Mode' toggle. When active, apps (like Notepad or Morse Code) don't take up the whole screen.
      Instead, they open in draggable, resizable windows with a taskbar at the bottom. This allows you to
      use multiple tools at once—for example, taking notes while playing a game or translating text.

    (description)
      A narrow, persistent 'data strip' at the bottom of the site. It acts like a technical ticker tape,
      streaming a mix of real data (Current Page, Scroll Speed, FPS) and atmospheric 'Ghost Data'
      (e.g., 'Decrypting_Memory_Bank...', 'Spirit_Found_at_0x004'). It pulses when you click things.

    (title) Subliminal Glitch Protocol
    (description)
      Hidden layers of mystery. Typing secret codes (like 'OVERLOAD') into the command palette triggers
      site-wide visual events (screen shake, color inversion). Hidden 'Ghost Comments' will be buried
      in the HTML code for developers to find, leading to secret unlisted pages.

    (title) Data-Reactive Generative Backdrops
    (description)
      The background art is currently random. This protocol makes it 'intelligent'. In the Morse Code app,
      the art pulses to your typing. In the Password Generator, it sharpens as your password gets stronger.
      The background becomes a visual echo of your actions.

    (title) Implementing Feature Flags for Banners
    (description)
      Sometimes, when we are adding features, we need to show a banner for down time.
      Current version does not show a banner.
      We may need to add a banner.piml to create a banner.
      This piml objects would contain info like:
      1. Type (warning, error, info, maybe???) for banners.
      2. From Date
      3. To Date
      4. Text
