## About

**The Outer Worlds** is a single-player action role-playing game developed by Obsidian Entertainment and published by Private Division. Released in October 2019, it is a new sci-fi RPG from the original creators of *Fallout* and *Fallout: New Vegas*. The game is set in an alternate future where mega-corporations have begun colonizing and terraforming planets, with the Halcyon colony being its primary setting.

Players awaken decades after being lost in transit while on a colonist ship bound for the Halcyon colony, only to find themselves embroiled in a deep conspiracy that threatens to destroy the colony. Guided by the rogue scientist Phineas Welles, players recruit a crew of companions and explore various planets and space stations, encountering diverse factions and making choices that will determine the fate of Halcyon.

Gameplay in *The Outer Worlds* features first-person combat with a variety of melee and ranged weapons, often augmented with scientific modifications. It includes a robust dialogue system with multiple choice options and skill checks, allowing players to resolve situations through combat, stealth, or persuasion. The character progression system is skill-based, with "Flaws" (optional permanent debuffs that grant bonus perk points) adding a unique layer of customization. The game is known for its darkly humorous tone, satirical critique of capitalism, and emphasis on player agency, with decisions having far-reaching consequences across the Halcyon colony.
