# PIML: Parenthesis Intended Markup Language

**Spec version**: v1.1.0

PIML (Parenthesis Intended Markup Language) is a data serialization format designed to be exceptionally human-readable and writable, while maintaining a clear and unambiguous structure for machine parsing. It was created to solve the frustrations found in JSON (too many brackets and quotes) and YAML (ambiguous indentation and type coercion).

## Core Design Goals

1. **Visual Scannability**: Use distinctive symbols `()` and `>` to make the data hierarchy visible at a glance.
2. **Minimalist Syntax**: Remove unnecessary noise like quotes and commas where they don't add value.
3. **Strict but Flexible**: Provide a clear structure that prevents common formatting errors while allowing for free-form text blocks.

## Structural Overview

PIML's power lies in its three primary building blocks:

### 1. The Key-Value Pair
Defined by parentheses. `(name) PIML` is a complete entry. No quotes needed for the key or simple string values.

### 2. The List Item
Defined by the `>` symbol. It allows for vertical lists that are incredibly easy to read and reorder.
```piml
(tags)
  > data
  > markup
  > human-centric
```

### 3. The Nested Object
Objects are created by placing key-value pairs or list items inside a parent key using indentation.
```piml
(database)
  (host) 127.0.0.1
  (settings)
    (timeout) 30
    (logging) true
```

## Advanced Type Handling

PIML handles complex types with ease:
- **Booleans**: `true` and `false`.
- **Numbers**: Integers and floating-point numbers.
- **Nulls**: Represented by `nil`.
- **Text Blocks**: Multi-line strings are handled by indenting text under a key, maintaining all line breaks and internal formatting.

## Adoption

PIML is ideally suited for configuration files, manifest declarations, and any data storage where humans are expected to interact with the raw file regularly.
