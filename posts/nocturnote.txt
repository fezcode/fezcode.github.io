## Nocturnote: The Text Editor I Always Wanted
Have you ever felt like your text editor is either doing too much or too little? That's exactly how I felt before I started building **Nocturnote**.

**Nocturnote** is my take on a modern, distraction-free writing environment. It's a sleek, cross-platform desktop application designed for those who want to just *write*, but with the comfort of modern tools.

## Why Nocturnote?

I wanted something that looked good, felt fast, and offered just the right amount of customization without being overwhelming.

### Key Features

*   **Distraction-Free Interface**: Clean lines, subtle colors, and a focus on your text.
*   **Rain Mode**: This is one of my favorites. Toggle it on for a soothing visual effect that adds a cozy atmosphere to your writing sessions.
*   **Notepad Mode**: Sometimes you just want that classic, stripped-back aesthetic. Nocturnote has you covered.
*   **Full Customization**: Change fonts, sizes, line heights, and more. Make it yours.

## Under the Hood

For the tech-savvy, Nocturnote is built using a robust modern stack:

*   **Electron**: Ensuring it runs smoothly on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
*   **Svelte 5**: For a blazing fast and reactive user interface.
*   **TypeScript**: Because type safety is non-negotiable.
*   **Tailwind CSS**: For rapid and beautiful styling.
*   **Electron-Vite**: For a lightning-fast development experience.
