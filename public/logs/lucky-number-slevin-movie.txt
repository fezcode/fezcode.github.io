The intricate plot revolves around Slevin Kelevra (Josh Hartnett), a man who arrives in New York City to stay with his friend Nick Fisher, only to find himself embroiled in a deadly gang war. Mistaken for Nick, Slevin is forced by "The Boss" (Morgan Freeman) to assassinate the son of his rival, "The Rabbi" (Ben Kingsley), to settle a gambling debt.
