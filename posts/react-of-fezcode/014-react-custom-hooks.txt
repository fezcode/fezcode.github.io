# 014 - React: Custom Hooks

Custom Hooks are a powerful feature in React that allow you to extract reusable stateful logic from components. They are JavaScript functions whose names start with `use` and that can call other Hooks. Custom Hooks solve the problem of sharing logic between components without relying on prop drilling or complex patterns like render props or higher-order components.

## Why Use Custom Hooks?

1.  **Reusability**: Extract common logic (state, effects, context) into a single function that can be used across multiple components.
2.  **Readability**: Components become cleaner and easier to understand as their logic is separated from their UI concerns.
3.  **Maintainability**: Changes to shared logic only need to be made in one place.
4.  **Testability**: Logic extracted into custom hooks can often be tested more easily in isolation.

## How to Create a Custom Hook

A custom Hook is a JavaScript function that:

*   Starts with the word `use` (e.g., `useFriendStatus`, `useToast`). This naming convention is crucial for React to know that it's a Hook and to apply the rules of Hooks (e.g., only call Hooks at the top level of a React function).
*   Can call other Hooks (e.g., `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`).
*   Can return anything: stateful values, functions, or nothing.

## Example: `useToast` Custom Hook (`src/hooks/useToast.js`)

This project provides an excellent example of a custom hook: `useToast`. It encapsulates the logic for accessing the toast notification system's `addToast` and `removeToast` functions.

### `src/hooks/useToast.js`

```javascript
import { useContext } from 'react';
import { ToastContext } from '../components/ToastContext';

export const useToast = () => {
  return useContext(ToastContext);
};
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`import { useContext } from 'react';`**: The custom hook itself uses another built-in Hook, `useContext`, to access the value provided by the `ToastContext`.
2.  **`import { ToastContext } from '../components/ToastContext';`**: It imports the `ToastContext` object, which was created in `ToastContext.js`.
3.  **`export const useToast = () => { ... };`**: This defines the custom hook. Its name `useToast` clearly indicates its purpose and follows the naming convention.
4.  **`return useContext(ToastContext);`**: The core of this hook. It retrieves the `value` (which contains `addToast` and `removeToast` functions) from the nearest `ToastContext.Provider` in the component tree and returns it. This means any component calling `useToast()` will receive these functions.

### How `useToast` is Used in a Component (e.g., `BlogPostPage.js`)

```javascript
// Inside BlogPostPage.js (or any other component that needs toasts)
import { useToast } from '../hooks/useToast';

const CodeBlock = ({ /* ... */ }) => {
  const { addToast } = useToast(); // Access addToast function

  const handleCopy = () => {
    // ... copy logic ...
    addToast({
      title: 'Success',
      message: 'Copied to clipboard!',
      duration: 3000,
    });
    // ...
  };
  // ...
};
```

By calling `const { addToast } = useToast();`, the `CodeBlock` component (or any other component) gains direct access to the `addToast` function without needing to know where `ToastContext` is defined or how the toast state is managed. This makes the `CodeBlock` component cleaner and more focused on its primary responsibility.

## Another Potential Custom Hook (Conceptual Example)

Consider the scroll tracking logic in `BlogPostPage.js`:

```javascript
// src/pages/BlogPostPage.js - inside BlogPostPage component
const [readingProgress, setReadingProgress] = useState(0);
const [isAtTop, setIsAtTop] = useState(true);
const contentRef = useRef(null);

useEffect(() => {
  const handleScroll = () => {
    if (contentRef.current) {
      const { scrollTop, scrollHeight, clientHeight } =
        document.documentElement;
      const totalHeight = scrollHeight - clientClientHeight;
      const currentProgress = (scrollTop / totalHeight) * 100;
      setReadingProgress(currentProgress);
      setIsAtTop(scrollTop === 0);
    }
  };

  window.addEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);
  return () => window.removeEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);
}, [post]);
```

This logic could be extracted into a custom hook, for example, `useScrollProgress`:

```javascript
// src/hooks/useScrollProgress.js (Conceptual)
import { useState, useEffect, useRef } from 'react';

const useScrollProgress = (contentRef, dependency) => {
  const [readingProgress, setReadingProgress] = useState(0);
  const [isAtTop, setIsAtTop] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    const handleScroll = () => {
      if (contentRef.current) {
        const { scrollTop, scrollHeight, clientHeight } =
          document.documentElement;
        const totalHeight = scrollHeight - clientHeight;
        const currentProgress = (scrollTop / totalHeight) * 100;
        setReadingProgress(currentProgress);
        setIsAtTop(scrollTop === 0);
      }
    };

    window.addEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);
    return () => window.removeEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);
  }, [contentRef, dependency]); // Re-run if contentRef or dependency changes

  return { readingProgress, isAtTop };
};

export default useScrollProgress;
```

Then, `BlogPostPage.js` would become cleaner:

```javascript
// src/pages/BlogPostPage.js - inside BlogPostPage component
const contentRef = useRef(null);
const { readingProgress, isAtTop } = useScrollProgress(contentRef, post);
// ...
```

This demonstrates how custom hooks can abstract away complex logic, making components more focused and easier to read.

## Summary

Custom Hooks are a fundamental pattern in modern React development for sharing stateful logic. By following the `use` naming convention and leveraging other built-in Hooks, you can create highly reusable and maintainable code that enhances the overall architecture of your React applications.
