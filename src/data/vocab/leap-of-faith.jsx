        The <strong className="text-current">Leap of Faith</strong> is a concept
        by Søren Kierkegaard. It describes the act of believing in something
        without, or in spite of, empirical evidence.

        "To have faith is to lose your mind and to win God."
      </div>

      <p>
        Kierkegaard argued that objective certainty is impossible in religious
        matters. True faith requires risk and passion; it is a subjective choice
        made in the face of the [Absurd](/vocab/absurdism).
