# High-Performance Rendering

At the heart of CartoGo lies a custom rendering engine built on top of the `gg` library. Optimized for 2D vector-like graphics operations in Go.

## Key Features
- **Z-Order Management**: Layering ensures water bodies, parks, and roads render correctly.
- **Alpha Blending**: Custom `NRGBA` gradient fades for the signature "fading edge" look.
- **Projection**: Precision conversion from Lat/Lon to local meter-based coordinate systems.
