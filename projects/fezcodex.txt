# Fezcodex: The Digital Sanctum

![Fezcodex - Cover Art](/images/projects/fezcodex.webp)

**Fezcodex** is more than just a portfolio; it's a living digital garden, a personal operating system, and a testament to the brutalist aesthetic of the modern web. Built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**, it serves as the central hub for my development journey, thoughts, and experiments.

> "A reflection of the developer's soul, rendered in code and pixels."

## Core Philosophy

Fezcodex was designed to break away from the sterile, corporate look of standard portfolios. It embraces:
*   **Brutalism:** Raw, unpolished, and honest UI elements.
*   **Interactivity:** A command palette, hidden modes, and easter eggs that reward exploration.
*   **Performance:** Blazing fast navigation and optimized asset loading.

## Key Features

*   **The Command Palette:** Navigate, toggle themes, or hack the system with a `Cmd+K` interface.
*   **Visual Modes:** Switch between `Cyberpunk`, `Retro`, `Terminal`, and more to match your mood.
*   **Dynamic Content:** Integrated blog engine with support for complex markdown, code highlighting, and live component rendering.
*   **Project Showcase:** Immersive deep-dives into my work (like the page you're on now).
*   **Digital Garden:** A space for raw notes, logs, and work-in-progress thoughts.

## Tech Stack & Architecture

Fezcodex is built on a modern stack designed for scalability and developer experience:

*   **Frontend:** React (Create React App + Craco) for component-based architecture.
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for utility-first design, augmented with custom animations via Framer Motion.
*   **Routing:** React Router DOM for seamless client-side navigation.
*   **Content:** Custom Markdown pipeline using `remark` and `rehype` for rich text processing.
*   **State:** React Context API for managing global themes, audio, and user preferences.
