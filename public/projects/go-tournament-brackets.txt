This is a simple and flexible Go library for creating and managing single-elimination tournament brackets. It also includes a fully interactive command-line application to run a tournament from start to finish.

## Key Components:

*   **Go Library:** Provides data models and functions for programmatic tournament logic, correctly calculating rounds, match-ups, and byes for any number of participants.
*   **Interactive CLI:** A runnable application that uses the library to offer a step-by-step command-line interface. Users can input participant names, generate a bracket, and determine match winners until a champion is crowned.

## Features:

*   **Single-Elimination Brackets:** Generates standard single-elimination tournament structures.
*   **Automatic Bye Handling:** Manages byes for participant numbers that are not powers of two.
*   **Interactive CLI:** Real-time tournament management through a terminal application.
*   **ASCII Bracket Display:** Visualizes the current bracket state in the console.
*   **Simple and Extensible:** Designed with clear data models for easy extension.

## Usage:

**As a Library:** Install with `go get github.com/fezcode/go-tournament-brackets`.

- Here is an example usage:
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/fezcode/go-tournament-brackets"
)

func main() {
	participants := []string{"Team Alpha", "Team Bravo", "Team Charlie", "Team Delta", "Team Echo"}
	// Create a new tournament
	tourney, err := tournament.NewTournament("My Cup", tournament.SingleElimination, participants, nil)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	// Print the initial bracket state
	tourney.PrintAscii()
	// From here, you can programmatically set winners and advance them
	// For example, to set Team Alpha (ID: 1) as the winner of their first match:
	// tourney.SetWinner(roundIndex, matchIndex, 1)
}
```
