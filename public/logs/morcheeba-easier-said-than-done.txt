## About

**Morcheeba** is a British electronic band formed in 1995 with members Skye Edwards, Paul Godfrey, and Ross Godfrey. They blend trip-hop, R&B, and pop influences.

**Skye Edwards' Return**: "Blood Like Lemonade" marked the significant return of lead singer Skye Edwards to Morcheeba, who had previously left the band in 2003. Her distinctive vocals are a prominent feature of the track.

**Lyrical Theme**: The song's lyrics delve into the common human experience of knowing what needs to be done, such as letting go or trusting oneself, but finding it challenging to actually execute those actions. The phrase "It's easier said than done" encapsulates this theme of difficulty in translating intention into action.

**Album Success**: The album "Blood Like Lemonade," which includes "Easier Said Than Done," achieved commercial success, earning a silver certification from the Independent Music Companies Association in 2010 for selling over 30,000 copies in Europe. It was later upgraded to gold certification in 2011 for exceeding 75,000 copies sold across Europe.
