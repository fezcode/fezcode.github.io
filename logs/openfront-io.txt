## What is OpenFront.io
**OpenFront.io** is an engaging and straightforward real-time strategy game.
Players start with land and can expand their influence by building cities, factories, ports, missile launchers, and defensive structures.
To conquer new territories, you'll send ships to claim distant lands.
The core gameplay revolves around forming alliances, establishing automated trades, and ultimately conquering opponents.
It's particularly enjoyable when played with friends. However, be warned: the late game often descends into an 'armageddon'
where players amass wealth to unleash devastating bombs upon each other. Betrayal is not just a possibility, but an expectation,
as alliances crumble under the weight of ambition. As of October 17, 2025, the game is in its alpha stage. Being open-source,
players are encouraged to contribute to its development and shape its future. You can always join the community and make OpenFront.io better.

> So what you see here, in this image, is the late stages of a free for all game. They are going to drop bombs to each other in a minute...

There are lots of options. You can create private lobbies. You can choose your map, your bots difficulty, whether bots should exist, the mode
`Free for All` or `Teams`, how many bot nations should be there (upto 400), instant build for all types of buildings, infinite money and troops... to make your friends even *MORE* angrier.

## Conclusion

With or without friends, it is one of the greatest strategy games of all time, AAA titles included. I was craving for some *Starcraft* or *Warcraft* style action but found enjoyment in this one.
Wonderful game, play it!
