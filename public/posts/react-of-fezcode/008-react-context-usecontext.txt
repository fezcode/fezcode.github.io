# 008 - React Context API and `useContext`

The React Context API provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. This is particularly useful for global data (like user authentication, theme, or in this case, toast notifications) that many components might need access to.

## The Problem Context Solves (Prop Drilling)

Imagine you have a deeply nested component tree, and a piece of data (e.g., a user object) is needed by a component several levels down. Without Context, you'd have to pass that data as a prop through every intermediate component, even if those components don't directly use the data. This is known as "prop drilling" and can make your code verbose and harder to maintain.

## How Context API Works

The Context API consists of three main parts:

1.  **`createContext`**: Creates a Context object. When React renders a component that subscribes to this Context object, it will read the current context value from the closest matching `Provider` above it in the tree.
2.  **`Provider`**: A React component that allows consuming components to subscribe to context changes. It accepts a `value` prop to be passed to consuming components that are descendants of this Provider.
3.  **`useContext`**: A React Hook that lets you read context from a functional component.

## Example: Toast Notification System

This project uses the Context API to manage and display toast notifications globally. Let's examine `src/components/ToastContext.js` and `src/hooks/useToast.js`.

### `src/components/ToastContext.js` (The Provider)

```javascript
import React, { createContext, useState, useCallback } from 'react';
import Toast from './Toast';

export const ToastContext = createContext();

let id = 0; // Simple counter for unique toast IDs

export const ToastContext = ({ children }) => {
  const [toasts, setToasts] = useState([]); // State to hold active toasts

  const addToast = useCallback((toast) => {
    const newToast = { ...toast, id: id++ };
    setToasts((prevToasts) => {
      if (prevToasts.length >= 5) { // Limit to 5 toasts
        const updatedToasts = prevToasts.slice(0, prevToasts.length - 1);
        return [newToast, ...updatedToasts];
      }
      return [newToast, ...prevToasts];
    });
  }, []); // Memoize addToast function

  const removeToast = useCallback((id) => {
    setToasts((prevToasts) => prevToasts.filter((toast) => toast.id !== id));
  }, []); // Memoize removeToast function

  return (
    <ToastContext.Provider value={{ addToast, removeToast }}>
      {children}
      <div className="fixed top-28 right-10 z-50">
        {toasts.map((toast) => (
          <Toast
            key={toast.id}
            id={toast.id}
            title={toast.title}
            message={toast.message}
            duration={toast.duration}
            removeToast={removeToast}
          />
        ))}
      </div>
    </ToastContext.Provider>
  );
};
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`export const ToastContext = createContext();`**: A Context object named `ToastContext` is created. This object will be used by both the Provider and the Consumer.
2.  **`ToastContext` Component**: This is a functional component that will wrap parts of your application (as seen in `App.js`).
    *   **`const [toasts, setToasts] = useState([]);`**: Manages the array of active toast notifications using `useState`.
    *   **`addToast` and `removeToast` functions**: These functions are responsible for adding new toasts to the `toasts` array and removing them. They are wrapped in `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-creations, which is an optimization for performance.
    *   **`<ToastContext.Provider value={{ addToast, removeToast }}>`**: This is the core of the Provider. It makes the `addToast` and `removeToast` functions available to any component that consumes `ToastContext` and is rendered within this Provider's tree. The `value` prop is crucial here.
    *   **`{children}`**: This renders whatever components are passed as children to the `ToastContext`. These children (and their descendants) will have access to the context value.
    *   **Toast Rendering**: The `ToastContext` also directly renders the actual `Toast` components based on the `toasts` state, positioning them in the top-right corner of the screen.

### `src/hooks/useToast.js` (The Consumer Hook)

```javascript
import { useContext } from 'react';
import { ToastContext } from '../components/ToastContext';

export const useToast = () => {
  return useContext(ToastContext);
};
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`import { useContext } from 'react';`**: Imports the `useContext` Hook from React.
2.  **`import { ToastContext } from '../components/ToastContext';`**: Imports the `ToastContext` object that was created in `ToastContext.js`.
3.  **`export const useToast = () => { ... };`**: This is a custom hook. Custom hooks are a powerful feature in React that allow you to extract reusable stateful logic from components. This `useToast` hook simplifies consuming the `ToastContext`.
4.  **`return useContext(ToastContext);`**: This line is where the magic happens. When `useContext(ToastContext)` is called, React looks up the component tree for the closest `ToastContext.Provider` and returns its `value` prop. In this case, it returns `{ addToast, removeToast }`.

### How it's Used in a Component (e.g., `BlogPostPage.js`)

```javascript
// Inside BlogPostPage.js (or any other component that needs toasts)
import { useToast } from '../hooks/useToast';

const CodeBlock = ({ /* ... */ }) => {
  const { addToast } = useToast(); // Access addToast function

  const handleCopy = () => {
    // ... copy logic ...
    addToast({
      title: 'Success',
      message: 'Copied to clipboard!',
      duration: 3000,
    });
    // ...
  };
  // ...
};
```

Any component that needs to display a toast simply imports and calls `useToast()`, and it immediately gets access to the `addToast` function without needing to receive it as a prop from its parent.

## Summary

The React Context API, combined with the `useContext` hook, provides an elegant solution for managing global state and sharing functions across your component tree, avoiding prop drilling and making your application's architecture cleaner and more maintainable. The toast notification system in this project is a prime example of its effective use.
