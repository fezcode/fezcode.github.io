# piml.js

**Spec version**: v1.1.0

`piml.js` is the definitive JavaScript implementation of the PIML (Parenthesis Intended Markup Language) specification. Designed for the modern web, it provides a lightweight, zero-dependency solution for parsing and stringifying PIML data. 

PIML was born from a desire to bridge the gap between the strictness of JSON and the verbosity of XML. By utilizing a unique parenthesis-based key structure and indentation-sensitive nesting, PIML offers a "human-first" data format that is as easy to write as it is to read.

## Design Philosophy

- **Human-Centric**: Writing configuration should feel like writing a document, not a math equation.
- **Structural Clarity**: Parentheses clearly define the start of a key-value pair, while indentation handles the hierarchy.
- **Zero Ambiguity**: Unlike YAML, PIML avoids complex edge cases in its indentation logic, making it predictable for both humans and machines.

## Extended Format Example

```piml
(site_name) PIML Ecosystem
(port) 8080
(is_production) false

(database)
  (adapter) postgresql
  (host) 127.0.0.1
  (pool_size) 25

(admins)
  > (User)
    (id) 1
    (name) Alice
    (roles)
      > superuser
      > developer
  > (User)
    (id) 2
    (name) Bob
    (roles)
      > analyst

(content_blocks)
  (hero)
    This is a multi-line block of text
    that maintains its formatting perfectly.
    
    Indentation is respected within blocks.

(metadata)
  (tags)
    > javascript
    > parser
    > markup
```

## Why piml.js?

In a world of bloated configuration libraries, `piml.js` stands out for its simplicity. It is perfect for local configuration, static site metadata, or any scenario where readability is paramount.
