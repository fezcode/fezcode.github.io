    (title) Syntax, the Codex Companion Deployed

Syntax features a persistent virtual-pet logic with real-time screen traversal, technical 'thought' generation, and contextual awareness. It adapts its molecular structure to match active themes (Brutalist/Luxe) and reacts to the user's journey through the digital garden.

    (title) Multimodal Project Layouts
    (description) Implemented a polymorphic layout system for project pages, allowing projects to define their own visual identity via specialized 'Styles'. Launched four distinct protocols: 'Stylish' (e.g., Fezcodex), 'Museum' (e.g., PIML), 'Editorial' (e.g., Dush, BM), and 'Minimal Modern' (e.g., Yap). Each style adapts the UI to match the project's unique character.

    (title) Major SEO Refactoring: Declarative Metadata
    (description) Executed a site-wide architectural shift from imperative 'useSeo' hooks to a declarative '<Seo />' component system. This transition ensures that React 19 metadata hoisting is correctly utilized during Static Site Generation (SSG) via react-snap, enabling crawlers to capture full SEO payloads before hydration. Optimized 130+ pages and implemented standard path mapping for improved compatibility.
