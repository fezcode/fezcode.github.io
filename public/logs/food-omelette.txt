This recipe will guide you through the process of making a classic French-style omelette, known for its smooth, tender texture and creamy interior.

### Ingredients

| Ingredient      | Amount     |
| --------------- | ---------- |
| Eggs            | 3          |
| Butter          | 1 tbsp     |
| Salt            | 1/4 tsp    |
| Black Pepper    | to taste   |
| Optional Fillings | as desired |

### Instructions

1.  **Prepare the Eggs:** Crack the eggs into a bowl and whisk them until the yolks and whites are just combined. Do not over-whisk, as this can make the omelette tough.
2.  **Heat the Pan:** Place a non-stick skillet over medium-high heat and add the butter. Swirl the pan to coat the bottom and sides with the melted butter.
3.  **Cook the Omelette:** When the butter is foamy, pour the eggs into the pan. Let them cook for a few seconds, then use a spatula to gently push the cooked eggs from the edges toward the center of the pan. Tilt the pan to allow the uncooked eggs to flow to the edges.
4.  **Add Fillings (Optional):** If you are using fillings, add them to one half of the omelette now.
5.  **Fold and Serve:** When the omelette is mostly set but still slightly soft in the center, fold it in half and slide it onto a plate. Serve immediately.

### A Brief History of the Omelette

The omelette has a long and storied history, with its origins dating back to ancient times. The first known omelette was made in ancient Persia, where it was called "kookoo." The modern omelette, however, is believed to have originated in France in the 16th century.

The word "omelette" is derived from the French word "amelette," which means "blade." This is a reference to the long, thin shape of the classic French omelette.

The omelette has been a staple of French cuisine for centuries, and it has been enjoyed by everyone from peasants to kings. It is a simple yet elegant dish that is a testament to the versatility of the humble egg.
