## About

**Fallout 4** is an action role-playing game developed by Bethesda Game Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks. Released in November 2015, it is the fifth major installment in the *Fallout* series. The game is set in a post-apocalyptic Boston, Massachusetts, and the surrounding Massachusetts Commonwealth, approximately 210 years after a devastating nuclear war.

Players begin as the Sole Survivor of Vault 111, emerging from cryogenic stasis to a world irrevocably changed. Their quest is to find their abducted son, Shaun, and seek revenge for the murder of their spouse. Along the way, players explore a vast open world, encountering various factions, mutated creatures, and remnants of humanity struggling to survive in the wasteland.

*Fallout 4* introduces several new gameplay mechanics to the series, most notably a comprehensive settlement-building system, allowing players to construct and manage their own communities. The game features real-time combat with VATS (Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System) returning, offering strategic targeting in slow motion. Character progression is handled through a SPECIAL (Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility, Luck) system and an extensive perk chart. The game emphasizes exploration, scavenging, crafting, and player choice, with numerous quests and emergent storytelling opportunities.
