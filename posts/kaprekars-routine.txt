Have you ever played with numbers and found a surprising pattern? One such fascinating pattern is hidden within **Kaprekar's Routine**, named after the Indian mathematician D.R. Kaprekar. It's a simple game that, for most four-digit numbers, always leads to the same result: **6174**.

Let's dive in and see how it works!

## The Rules of the Game

1.  **Pick a four-digit number** with at least two different digits. (Numbers like 1111, 2222, etc., won't work).
2.  **Arrange the digits** to form the largest possible number.
3.  **Arrange the same digits** to form the smallest possible number.
4.  **Subtract** the smallest number from the largest number.
5.  **Repeat** steps 2-4 with the new number you get.

You'll be amazed at what happens!

## Example 1: Starting with 3524

Let's try with the number **3524**:

*   **Step 1:** Our number is 3524. It has different digits.
*   **Step 2:** Largest number: 5432
*   **Step 3:** Smallest number: 2345
*   **Step 4:** Subtract: 5432 - 2345 = **3087**

Now, we repeat the process with **3087**:

*   **Step 2:** Largest number: 8730
*   **Step 3:** Smallest number: 0378 (remember to include leading zeros to keep it a four-digit number)
*   **Step 4:** Subtract: 8730 - 0378 = **8352**

Repeat with **8352**:

*   **Step 2:** Largest number: 8532
*   **Step 3:** Smallest number: 2358
*   **Step 4:** Subtract: 8532 - 2358 = **6174**

And there it is! We reached 6174.

## Example 2: Starting with 1987

Let's try another one with **1987**:

*   **Step 1:** Our number is 1987.
*   **Step 2:** Largest number: 9871
*   **Step 3:** Smallest number: 1789
*   **Step 4:** Subtract: 9871 - 1789 = **8082**

Repeat with **8082**:

*   **Step 2:** Largest number: 8820
*   **Step 3:** Smallest number: 0288
*   **Step 4:** Subtract: 8820 - 0288 = **8532**

Repeat with **8532**:

*   **Step 2:** Largest number: 8532
*   **Step 3:** Smallest number: 2358
*   **Step 4:** Subtract: 8532 - 2358 = **6174**

Again, we arrived at 6174!

## The Magic of 6174

This number, 6174, is known as **Kaprekar's Constant**. For almost any four-digit number (with at least two different digits), if you keep applying Kaprekar's routine, you will eventually reach 6174. Once you reach 6174, the next step will always be:

*   Largest: 7641
*   Smallest: 1467
*   Subtract: 7641 - 1467 = **6174**

It's a loop!

Kaprekar's routine is a wonderful example of how simple arithmetic operations can lead to unexpected and beautiful mathematical constants. Try it with your own four-digit numbers and see the magic unfold!
