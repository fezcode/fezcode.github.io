# Aether: The Cyberpunk Music Player

I've just deployed **Aether**, a new cloud-based music player for Fezcodex.

## Overview

Aether isn't just a music player; it's an atmospheric audio interface designed to immerse you in the soundscape of the site. It features:

*   **Cyberpunk Aesthetic:** A high-contrast, terminal-inspired interface with CRT scanlines, glitch effects, and a generative art background that reacts to the music.
*   **Persistent Playback:** A tiny, "cyber deck" style player docks to the bottom of your screen, allowing you to browse the site without interrupting your tunes.
*   **Generative Art:** If a track lacks cover art, the system generates a unique visual signature based on the track's title.

Enjoy the vibes.
