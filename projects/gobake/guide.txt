# Core Concepts

`gobake` operates on a simple principle: **Your build system should be as robust as your application.**

Instead of relying on fragile shell scripts or complex Makefiles, `gobake` uses:
1.  **Engine:** The core Go library that manages tasks.
2.  **Context:** A helper object passed to every task, providing access to the shell, logging, and metadata.
3.  **Recipe:** The `Recipe.go` file that ties it all together.

# CLI Command Reference

## Project Management

*   **`gobake init`**: Initialize a new project in the current directory.
*   **`gobake version`**: Show the current version of gobake.
*   **`gobake help`**: Show the list of available commands and project tasks.
*   **`gobake template <git-url>`**: Clone a repository and initialize it.

## Dependency & Tool Management

*   **`gobake add-tool <url>`**: Adds a tool to the `(tools)` list in `recipe.piml`.
*   **`gobake add-dep <url>`**: Adds a library dependency to `go.mod`.

## Versioning

*   **`gobake bump [patch|minor|major]`**: Increments the project version in `recipe.piml`.

# Metadata (`recipe.piml`)

The `recipe.piml` file is the single source of truth for your project.

```piml
(name) my-project
(version) 1.2.3
(authors)
    > Ahmed <ahmed@example.com>
(tools)
    > github.com/swaggo/swag/cmd/swag@latest
```

# Task Management

Tasks are defined using `bake.Task(name, description, function)`.

## Task Dependencies

You can define tasks that depend on other tasks using `bake.TaskWithDeps`.

```go
bake.Task("test", "Run tests", func(ctx *gobake.Context) error { ... })
bake.TaskWithDeps("build", "Build app", []string{"test"}, func(ctx *gobake.Context) error { ... })
```
