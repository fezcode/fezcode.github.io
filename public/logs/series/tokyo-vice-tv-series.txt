## About

**Tokyo Vice (2022)** is an American crime drama television series based on the 2009 non-fiction book of the same name by Jake Adelstein. Created by J.T. Rogers, the series premiered on HBO Max and is executive produced by Michael Mann, who also directed the pilot. The story follows Jake Adelstein (played by Ansel Elgort), an American journalist who moves to Tokyo in the late 1990s and becomes the first non-Japanese reporter to be hired at a major Japanese newspaper.

The series immerses viewers in the neon-drenched underworld of Tokyo's yakuza, exploring the complex relationships between crime, journalism, and law enforcement in a foreign culture. Jake quickly finds himself entangled in a dangerous web of corruption, moral ambiguity, and gang warfare as he strives to uncover the truth behind various crimes, often pushing the boundaries of traditional Japanese journalism.

Featuring a bilingual cast and extensive Japanese dialogue, *Tokyo Vice* is praised for its authentic portrayal of Japanese culture, its gripping plot, and its stylish direction. The series blends elements of procedural drama with a compelling character study, offering a unique glimpse into a hidden world and the personal cost of pursuing justice.
