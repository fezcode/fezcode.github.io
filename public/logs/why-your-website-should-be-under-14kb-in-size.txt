### Summary of "Why your website should be under 14kB in size"

The article argues that for optimal performance, a website's initial load should be under 14kB. This is due to the TCP slow start algorithm, which typically sends the first 10 TCP packets in the initial burst. Since each packet is about 1.46kB, this adds up to 14.6kB. By keeping the initial load under this size, a website can avoid additional round trips, significantly reducing latency and improving the user experience, especially on slower networks.

### Strong Sides

*   **Clear Technical Explanation:** The article does an excellent job of explaining a complex technical topic (TCP slow start) in a way that is easy to understand.
*   **Actionable Advice:** It provides concrete steps that developers can take to reduce their website's size, such as optimizing images, removing unnecessary frameworks, and prioritizing above-the-fold content.
*   **Relevant to Modern Web Development:** Despite the increasing availability of high-speed internet, the article correctly points out that many users still experience slow connections, making this advice highly relevant.

### Important Parts

*   **The 14kB Rule:** The core concept of the article, which is that a website's initial load should be under 14kB to avoid additional round trips.
*   **TCP Slow Start:** The underlying technical reason for the 14kB rule.
*   **Latency:** The article's emphasis on the importance of latency in user experience.
*   **Actionable Advice:** The practical steps that developers can take to reduce their website's size.
