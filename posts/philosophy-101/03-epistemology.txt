# Philosophy 101: Epistemology - How Do You Know That?

## The Matrix and the Brain in a Vat

How do you know you aren't a brain in a vat being fed electrical impulses by a mad scientist? How do you know this blog post isn't a hallucination?

Welcome to **[Epistemology](/vocab/epistemology)**: the study of knowledge.

Before we can claim to know anything about the world, we have to determine what "knowing" even means.

## The Classic Definition: JTB

For thousands of years, the gold standard for knowledge was **Justified True Belief (JTB)**.
To say "I know X," three things must happen:
1.  **You must believe X.** (You can't know it if you don't think it's true).
2.  **X must actually be true.** (You can't "know" the earth is flat, even if you believe it).
3.  **You must have justification.** (You can't just guess correctly; you need a reason).

## The Crash Course: Rationalism vs. Empiricism

This is the biggest cage match in the history of philosophy.

**1. Rationalism (Team Descartes)**
*   **Core Idea:** Reason is the chief source of knowledge.
*   **The Vibe:** "I can figure out the universe just by thinking hard enough."
*   **Key Figure:** René Descartes. He doubted everything—his senses, his memory, the physical world—until he hit bedrock: "I think, therefore I am." He couldn't doubt that he was doubting.

**2. Empiricism (Team Locke/Hume)**
*   **Core Idea:** Sensory experience is the source of knowledge.
*   **The Vibe:** "Show me the data."
*   **Key Concept:** *Tabula Rasa* (Blank Slate). We are born knowing nothing, and experience writes upon us.

## Radical Skepticism and Solipsism

If you take doubt far enough, you end up at **[Solipsism](/vocab/solipsism)**: the idea that only your own mind is sure to exist. Everyone else might be an NPC (Non-Playable Character).

It's a lonely philosophy, but logically, it's incredibly hard to disprove. (Try it. Go ahead. Prove to me you exist. I'll wait).

Next up, we ask the question that usually follows a bong rip: **What is actually real?** (Metaphysics).
