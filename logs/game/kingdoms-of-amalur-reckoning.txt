## About

**Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning** is a single-player action role-playing video game developed by 38 Studios and Big Huge Games. It was released in February 2012. The game is set in the Faelands, a high fantasy world with a rich history and lore, which was created by fantasy author R.A. Salvatore. The art style was overseen by comic book artist Todd McFarlane, and the combat system was designed by Ken Rolston, lead designer of *The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion*.

Players awaken as the "Fateless One," a unique individual who has died and been resurrected by the Well of Souls, making them immune to the fate-determining power of the Niskaru. This grants players the ability to reshape their destiny and the world around them. The game features a robust character customization system, allowing players to choose from four playable races and develop their character across three distinct skill trees: Might (warfare), Finesse (rogue), and Sorcery (magic). These skill trees can be mixed and matched, leading to a wide variety of combat styles and "destinies" that grant powerful bonuses.

Combat in *Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning* is action-oriented and often compared to hack-and-slash games, emphasizing fluid movements, timed blocks, dodges, and a wide array of abilities. The game world is expansive, filled with quests, dungeons, and a myriad of enemies to overcome. The narrative involves uncovering a plot by the Niskaru and their leader, Gadflow, to conquer the Faelands, and the player's role in stopping them.
