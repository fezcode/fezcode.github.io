## About
Set in a seaside sanitarium, "The Flowers of Buffoonery" follows Yozo Oba, recovering from a suicide attempt. Amidst a dispiriting atmosphere, his visitors and he strive to maintain a lighthearted, almost clownish demeanor, engaging in games and jokes. Osamu Dazai, known for exploring dark human emotions, here humorously examines the struggles of youth, love, self-hatred, and depression. This work offers a darkly humorous glimpse into the lives of prewar Japan's outsiders.

## My Thoughts
> Spoilers, be warned...

This book is both funny and sad. The way the characters try to handle their situation is very humane,
sad, and also great to see. It's short but well-written. However, you might not want to read it while you are depressed.
Enjoy!
