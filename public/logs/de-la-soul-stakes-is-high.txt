## De La Soul's "Stakes Is High": A Stand for Hip Hop's Soul

In the mid-90s, as hip hop found itself increasingly dominated by the East Coast vs. West Coast rivalry and a growing emphasis on commercial success, De La Soul took a stand. Their 1996 track, "Stakes Is High," served as a powerful critique of the state of the genre and a call to return to its more conscious roots.

The song, and the album of the same name, marked a significant shift for the group. Moving away from the lighter, more psychedelic vibes of their earlier work, "Stakes Is High" adopted a darker, more serious tone. The lyrics, delivered with a sense of urgency by Posdnuos and Dave, pull no punches. They express a deep frustration with the glorification of violence, materialism, and the overall decline in lyrical substance that they saw pervading hip hop culture.

Lines like, "I'm sick of bitches shakin' asses / I'm sick of talkin' about blunts / Sick of Versace glasses," and the declaration that the "Native Tongues have officially been re-instated," made their position clear. De La Soul was drawing a line in the sand, reminding listeners that the cultural and artistic integrity of hip hop was at stake.

*   **Native Tongues Reunion:** The music video for the song featured members of the Native Tongues collective, including A Tribe Called Quest, visually reinforcing the song's call for unity and a return to their roots.
*   **2Pac's Response:** The criticisms on the *Stakes Is High* album drew a response from 2Pac on the track "Against All Odds" from his posthumous album *The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory*.

"Stakes Is High" remains a pivotal track in hip hop history, a moment when one of the genre's most respected groups risked commercial success to make a statement about the music and culture they loved.

## Second Verse

```
>> -- Trugoy the Dove --

    I'm sick of bitches shakin' asses
    I'm sick of talkin' 'bout blunts, sick of Versace glasses
    Sick of slang, sick of half-ass awards shows
    Sick of name-brand clothes (Word)
    Sick of R&B bitches over bullshit tracks (Heard)
    Cocaine and crack, which brings sickness to blacks
    Sick of swoll'-head rappers with they sickenin' raps
    Clappers of gats, makin' the whole sick world collapse
    The facts are gettin' sicker, even sicker, perhaps (Sicker, perhaps)
    I Stickabush to make a bundle to escape this synapse
```
