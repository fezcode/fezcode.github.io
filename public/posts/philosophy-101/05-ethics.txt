# Philosophy 101: Ethics - What Should We Do?

## The Trolley Problem

You knew this was coming. A trolley is barreling down a track towards 5 people. You can pull a lever to switch it to a track with 1 person.
*   **Do you pull the lever?** (Kill 1 to save 5).
*   **Do you do nothing?** (Let 5 die to avoid "killing" anyone directly).

Welcome to **Ethics**.

## The Big Three Frameworks

Most moral arguments boil down to one of these three heavyweights:

**1. Utilitarianism (Outcomes)**
*   **The Vibe:** "The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few."
*   **Key Concept:** Maximize happiness, minimize suffering. It's math.
*   **The Trap:** If killing one innocent person saves 100 people, a strict [Utilitarian](/vocab/utilitarianism) says "Do it." Most people find this horrifying.

**2. Deontology (Duty/Rules)**
*   **The Vibe:** "Some things are just wrong, period."
*   **Key Figure:** Immanuel Kant.
*   **The Categorical Imperative:** Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law. (Translation: Don't do it if you wouldn't want *everyone* to do it).
*   **The Trap:** Lying is wrong. Therefore, if a murderer asks where your friend is hiding, you can't lie.

**3. Virtue Ethics (Character)**
*   **The Vibe:** "Don't ask 'what should I do?', ask 'what kind of person should I be?'"
*   **Key Figure:** Aristotle.
*   **Focus:** Courage, Temperance, Wisdom. It's about building habits of character so that you naturally do the right thing.

## Moral Relativism vs. Realism

*   **Relativism:** "Morality is just cultural taste, like preferring tea over coffee."
*   **Realism:** "Torturing babies is objectively wrong, regardless of what your culture thinks."

## Graduation

You have now completed **Philosophy 101**. You have the tools (Logic), you know the limits of what you can know (Epistemology), you've questioned reality (Metaphysics), and you've struggled with how to live (Ethics).

You are now officially qualified to be annoying at parties. _Go forth and think._
