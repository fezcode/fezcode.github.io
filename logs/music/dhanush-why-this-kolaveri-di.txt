The song 'Why This Kolaveri Di' translates roughly to 'Why this murderous rage, girl?' or 'Why this killer rage, girl?'. It tells the story of a man who is drunk and heartbroken after a love failure, questioning his girlfriend about why she left him. The song is often referred to as a 'soup song,' a term for a love failure song. Its lyrics are a distinctive blend of Tamil and English, known as 'Tanglish.' The song achieved immense popularity and became an internet phenomenon due to several factors: its catchy tune and simple music, the 'Tanglish' lyrics which made it accessible and relatable, its theme of unrequited love and heartbreak, and its viral spread through social media platforms. Dhanush's unpolished, 'mistake-filled' vocal delivery was perceived as fitting the song's casual tone and making it easily hummable.
