# gobake
A Go-native build orchestrator, type-safe and dependency-free.

**gobake** is a Go-native build orchestrator. It replaces Makefiles and shell scripts with a single, type-safe `Recipe.go` file. Inspired by `nob.h`, it allows you to write your build logic in Go, which is then compiled and executed on the fly.
