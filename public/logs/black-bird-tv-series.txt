## About

**Black Bird (2022)** is an American crime drama miniseries developed by Dennis Lehane, based on the 2010 non-fiction novel *In with the Devil: A Fallen Hero, a Serial Killer, and a Dangerous Bargain for Redemption* by James Keene and Hillel Levin. The series stars Taron Egerton as James "Jimmy" Keene, a high school football hero and son of a decorated police officer, who is sentenced to 10 years in a minimum-security prison for drug dealing. He is then offered an extraordinary deal: transfer to a maximum-security prison for the criminally insane and befriend suspected serial killer Larry Hall (Paul Walter Hauser), to elicit a confession and learn the locations of his victims' bodies before Hall's appeal goes through. If successful, Jimmy walks free; if not, he remains in prison with no possibility of parole.

The series is a gripping psychological drama that delves into the dark minds of its characters and the chilling world of serial killers. It explores themes of manipulation, truth, sacrifice, and the blurred lines between good and evil. Known for its intense atmosphere and stellar performances, particularly from Egerton and Hauser, *Black Bird* offers a harrowing and unforgettable true-crime narrative.

## My Thoughts

*Black Bird* is an utterly captivating and deeply disturbing true-crime drama that grabs you from the first minute and doesn't let go. It's a masterclass in psychological tension, driven by two absolutely phenomenal lead performances. Taron Egerton sheds his usual charisma to portray Jimmy Keene with a raw vulnerability and desperate determination, forced to confront unimaginable evil to secure his freedom.

But it's Paul Walter Hauser as Larry Hall who truly elevates the series to another level. His portrayal is chillingly nuanced – he's unsettling, pathetic, and subtly terrifying all at once. The conversations between Jimmy and Larry are the core of the show, creating an almost unbearable sense of dread and unease. You're constantly questioning Larry's honesty and Jimmy's ability to maintain his facade in such a hostile environment.

Dennis Lehane's writing is superb, crafting a tight, compelling narrative that feels both authentic and incredibly suspenseful. The series explores the murky depths of human depravity and the personal cost of seeking justice, leaving a lasting impact. The direction is precise, building atmosphere and tension with every scene. If you have an appetite for dark, intelligent, and impeccably acted true-crime, *Black Bird* is an absolute must-see. It's a powerful, unsettling, and unforgettable experience.
