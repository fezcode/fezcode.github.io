## Key Features:

*   **Add Bookmarks:** Add the current directory or a specified directory/file to your bookmarks.
    *   Options include `--add-anyway` (adds even if path doesn't exist), `--overwrite` (overwrites existing bookmarks), `--directory-only`, and `--file-only`.
*   **Show Bookmarks:** Display all bookmarks or a specific bookmark by name. Can be pretty-printed in a table format using `-p` or `--pretty`.

*   **Help & Version:** Access help text and version information.
*   **Debug Mode:** Activate debug mode for any command to see additional prints.

## Usage Examples:

*   `bm a HOME_DIR ~`: Add the home directory as `HOME_DIR`.
*   `cd $(bm s HOME_DIR)`: Change directory to the bookmarked `HOME_DIR`.
*   `bm s -p`: Show all bookmarks in a pretty table.
*   `bm d HOME_DIR`: Delete the `HOME_DIR` bookmark.
