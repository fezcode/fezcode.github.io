## About

**21 Jump Street (2012)** is an American action comedy film directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, and written by Michael Bacall from a story by Bacall and Jonah Hill. It is a cinematic adaptation of the 1987 television series of the same name. The film stars Jonah Hill as Schmidt and Channing Tatum as Jenko, two mismatched police officers who were high school acquaintances (one a nerd, the other a popular jock) and later became partners on the force. Due to their youthful appearances and lack of success in conventional police work, they are assigned to a revived undercover program, "21 Jump Street," where they pose as high school students to infiltrate a drug ring.

The film playfully subverts expectations, satirizing both the original TV series and common high school movie tropes. It blends buddy-cop action with sharp comedic writing, delivering unexpected laughs and genuine heart. It was a critical and commercial success, largely due to the unexpected comedic chemistry between Hill and Tatum, as well as its fresh and self-aware approach to the genre.
