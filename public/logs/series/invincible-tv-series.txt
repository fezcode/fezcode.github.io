## About

**Invincible (2021)** is an American adult animated superhero television series created by Robert Kirkman, based on his comic book series of the same name. The series premiered on Amazon Prime Video and quickly gained critical acclaim for its mature themes, brutal action sequences, and compelling storytelling. It follows the story of Mark Grayson, a seemingly normal seventeen-year-old whose father is Omni-Man, the most powerful superhero on Earth. Mark soon begins to develop his own superpowers and starts his journey as a hero, only to discover that his father's legacy—and the truth about his origins—are far more complicated and darker than he could have ever imagined.

The series deftly subverts traditional superhero tropes, presenting a world where extraordinary powers come with equally extraordinary, and often violent, consequences. It explores themes of family, betrayal, the burden of immense power, and the psychological toll of heroism. With its vibrant animation, strong voice cast, and unexpected narrative twists, *Invincible* offers a fresh and unflinching take on the superhero genre.
