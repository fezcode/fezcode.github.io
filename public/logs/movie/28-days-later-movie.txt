## About

**28 Days Later (2002)** is a British post-apocalyptic horror film directed by Danny Boyle and written by Alex Garland. The film opens with Jim (Cillian Murphy), a bicycle courier, who awakens from a coma in a deserted London hospital to find the city eerily silent and abandoned. He soon discovers that a highly contagious, rage-inducing virus has spread across the United Kingdom, turning most of the population into hyper-aggressive, bloodthirsty "infected" within 28 days.

Jim eventually encounters other survivors and together they attempt to navigate the desolate landscape, searching for safety and answers. The film is widely credited with revitalizing the zombie genre by introducing fast-moving, rabid infected rather than traditional slow-moving zombies, and for its raw, gritty aesthetic (shot largely on digital video) that enhanced its documentary-like feel. It explores themes of survival, human nature under extreme duress, and the breakdown of society, often highlighting the darkness within humanity as much as the external threat.
