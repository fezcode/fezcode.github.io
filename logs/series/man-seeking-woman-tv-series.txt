A surreal and hilarious exploration of modern dating. This show masterfully uses absurdism and metaphor to depict the anxieties,
awkwardness, and occasional magic of trying to find love. Each episode is a standalone comedic gem,
with brilliant visual gags and surprisingly poignant insights into relationships. The performances are fantastic,
particularly Jay Baruchel's portrayal of the perpetually unlucky-in-love Josh.
It's a truly unique and refreshing comedy that stands out from the crowd.
