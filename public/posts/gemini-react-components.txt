# Gemini's Guide to React - Understanding Components

In this second part of Gemini's Guide to React, we'll focus on one of React's most fundamental concepts: Components.

Components are independent, reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML via a render function. Components come in two types: Class Components and Functional Components. Modern React development primarily uses Functional Components with Hooks.

Example of a Functional Component:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

export default Welcome;
```

Next, we'll explore JSX and how it makes writing React components more intuitive.
