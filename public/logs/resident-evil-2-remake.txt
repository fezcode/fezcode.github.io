## About

**Resident Evil 2: Remake** is a survival horror game developed and published by Capcom. Released in January 2019, it is a complete remake of the 1998 classic, *Resident Evil 2*. The remake was built from the ground up, utilizing Capcom's proprietary RE Engine to deliver stunning photorealistic graphics, a new over-the-shoulder camera perspective, modernized controls, and a more immersive, terrifying experience while remaining faithful to the original's narrative and iconic moments.

The game is set in Raccoon City, a Midwestern American town that has been devastated by a viral outbreak. Players choose to play as either rookie police officer Leon S. Kennedy or college student Claire Redfield, each with their own distinct campaigns and story paths. Both protagonists find themselves trapped in the zombie-infested Raccoon City Police Department and must navigate through gruesome hordes of undead, mutated creatures, and solve intricate puzzles to escape the city and uncover the truth behind the Umbrella Corporation's involvement.

A standout feature is the relentless pursuit by the Tyrant (Mr. X), a nearly indestructible bio-organic weapon that stalks players throughout large sections of the game, creating constant tension and jump scares. The gameplay emphasizes resource management, exploration, and combat, striking a perfect balance between action and classic survival horror elements. It was universally praised for its atmosphere, graphics, and faithful yet fresh take on a beloved title.

## My Thoughts

*Resident Evil 2: Remake* is, in my opinion, the gold standard for how to remake a classic video game. Capcom didn't just give it a graphical overhaul; they meticulously rebuilt the entire experience, enhancing every aspect while staying true to the spirit of the original. The Raccoon City Police Department has never felt more oppressive or terrifying, with every shadow and sound contributing to an almost unbearable tension.

Playing as both Leon and Claire offers unique perspectives and challenges, making multiple playthroughs incredibly rewarding. The gunplay feels fantastic, and every shot matters, forcing you to think strategically about conserving ammunition. The puzzles are cleverly integrated into the environment, adding to the feeling of being a trapped survivor.

But the real star of the show is Mr. X. His persistent, heavy footsteps echoing through the halls are a constant source of dread, transforming familiar areas into terrifying gauntlets. He's not just an enemy; he's an environmental hazard that constantly changes your approach to the game. *Resident Evil 2: Remake* is a masterclass in survival horror design, delivering a fresh, terrifying, and deeply satisfying experience that honors its legacy while setting a new benchmark for the genre. It's a game that I've revisited multiple times and one that continues to impress with its craftsmanship.
