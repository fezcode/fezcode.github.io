Today was a huge day for Fezcodex. We did a "Major Refactor."

### What did we change?
1. **Brutalist Style**: We made the site look bold and strong, like a high-tech terminal. Big letters, sharp edges, and high contrast.
2. **Generative Art**: We added "math art" that draws itself in the background. It's unique every time you look at it!
3. **Timeline & Games**: We updated the Timeline and the Memory Game to fit this cool new look.
4. **The "Under the Hood" Stuff**: We cleaned up the code (the "linter" stuff). We removed unused pieces and fixed tiny mistakes that make the computer happy.

The garden is now cleaner, faster, and much more "Brutalist."

Enjoy the new vibe!
