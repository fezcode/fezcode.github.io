Websites should be **fun**. While optimizing performance and fixing bugs is satisfying, sometimes you just want to flip the table -or in this case-, the entire viewport.

Today, I'm excited to introduce a suite of new **Visual Modes** to Fezcodex. These are persistent, purely aesthetic toggles that let you experience the site in a completely different light (or lack thereof).

## The New Modes

### 1. Invert Colors (The Upside Down)
Ever wondered what the site looks like in negative? This mode inverts all colors but cleverly rotates the hue by 180 degrees. This prevents photos from looking like scary X-rays and instead creates a cool, alternative color palette.

### 2. Retro Mode (Cyberpunk 2077)
Feeling nostalgic? Enable Retro Mode to overlay a CRT scanline effect and chromatic aberration (that red/blue text split). It gives the entire UI a gritty, 80s sci-fi terminal vibe.

### 3. Party Mode (RGB Everywhere)
Boots and cats and boots and cats. This mode continuously cycles the screen's hue through the entire rainbow. Warning: It's colorful. Very colorful.

### 4. Mirror Mode (Through the Looking Glass)
For those who want a challenge. This flips the entire website horizontally. Text is backwards, layouts are reversed, and your mouse muscle memory will be thoroughly confused. Good luck navigating!

### 5. Noir Mode (Dramatic Effect)
It was a dark and stormy night... This mode applies a high-contrast grayscale filter, turning the site into a scene from a classic detective film.

### 6. Terminal Mode (The Hacker)
Jack in. This mode transforms the entire UI into a monochrome green CRT monitor aesthetic. Perfect for feeling like you're browsing the web from a bunker in 1999.

### 7. Blueprint Mode (The Architect)
For those who appreciate structure. This applies a deep blue, inverted schematic look, making the site resemble an architectural blueprint.

### 8. Sepia Mode (The Time Traveler)
Dust off the archives. This gives everything a warm, aged parchment tone, perfect for reading through the D&D logs or imagining the site as an ancient manuscript.

## How to Access Them

You can unlock these modes in two ways:

### 1. The Command Palette (For the Power User)
Press `Alt + K` (or click the "Commands" button in the sidebar) to open the Command Palette. Then, simply type:
*   `Toggle Invert Colors`
*   `Toggle Retro Mode`
*   `Party Mode`
*   `Toggle Mirror Mode`
*   `Toggle Noir Mode`
*   `Toggle Terminal Mode`
*   `Toggle Blueprint Mode`
*   `Toggle Sepia Mode`
*   ...or try `Do a Barrel Roll` for a quick spin!

### 2. The Settings Page (For the Clicker)
Head over to the [Settings page](/settings) (accessible from the Sidebar). Scroll down to the new **Visual Effects** section, where you'll find toggle switches for all persistent modes.

## Under the Hood

Implementing these was a fun exercise in CSS filters and React context.
*   **Persistence:** We use a custom `usePersistentState` hook (wrapper around `localStorage`) to remember your choices, so your Retro Mode stays on even after you refresh.
*   **CSS Magic:** Most effects use `backdrop-filter` on a fixed pseudo-element (`body::after`). This was crucial to ensure that `position: fixed` elements (like the Sidebar) didn't break or scroll away when the filters were applied.
*   **Global Context:** A new `VisualSettingsContext` manages the state application-wide, ensuring that the Settings page and Command Palette stay in sync.

Go ahead, break the UI. It's a feature, not a bug.
