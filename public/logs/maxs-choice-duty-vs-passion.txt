## About

Kärtsy Hatakka and Kimmo Kajasto are Finnish musicians who composed the soundtracks for the video games Max Payne and Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne.
Kärtsy Hatakka is the vocalist, bassist, and keyboardist for the Finnish rock band Waltari. Kimmo Kajasto is a composer, sound producer,
and has worked with many Finnish bands.

The theme song from Max Payne 2 is a masterpiece. It perfectly captures the dark, noir atmosphere of the game.
The melancholic cello, the haunting piano melody, and the subtle electronic elements all work together to create a sense of dread and despair.
It's a song that stays with you long after you've finished playing the game. It's the perfect music to listen to when you're in a contemplative mood,
or when you just want to feel like a hard-boiled detective in a cynical world.
