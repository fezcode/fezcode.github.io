## About

**Heat (1995)** is an American crime drama film written and directed by Michael Mann. The film is celebrated for being the first on-screen pairing of Al Pacino and Robert De Niro in a full scene, portraying a cat-and-mouse game between a meticulous, professional thief and an obsessive LAPD detective. Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) leads a highly skilled crew of bank robbers, whose latest heist draws the attention of Lieutenant Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino), a workaholic detective whose personal life is crumbling under the weight of his profession.

The narrative intricately weaves together the professional and personal lives of both men and their crews, showcasing their parallel struggles with commitment, isolation, and the relentless demands of their chosen paths. *Heat* is renowned for its gritty realism, particularly in its iconic bank robbery and street shootout sequences, which are often cited as some of the most authentic in cinema history. The film explores themes of professionalism, loyalty, fate, and the philosophical similarities between hunter and hunted, all set against a stunningly photographed, nocturnal Los Angeles backdrop.
