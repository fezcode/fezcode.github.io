## About

**Community (2009)** is an American television sitcom created by Dan Harmon. The series follows a diverse group of students attending Greendale Community College in the fictional town of Greendale, Colorado. At the center is Jeff Winger, a disbarred lawyer who enrolls to get a legitimate degree and forms a study group that quickly becomes the core of the show. The group includes socially awkward Abed Nadir, activist Britta Perry, single mother Shirley Bennett, former football star Troy Barnes, pop culture enthusiast Annie Edison, and wealthy elderly Pierce Hawthorne.

*Community* is renowned for its meta-humor, frequent pop culture references, and innovative approach to storytelling, often parodying film and television genres in a single episode (e.g., a zombie apocalypse, a spaghetti western, a stop-motion Christmas special). The show gained a loyal cult following for its sharp writing, complex character dynamics, and its ability to blend humor with genuine emotional depth.
