# Dreamed at Dawn - The Away Days

The Away Days are an indie rock / dream pop band from Istanbul, Turkey. Formed in 2012, they have managed to create a unique sound that blends the melancholic textures of shoegaze with the rhythmic energy of 21st-century indie rock. They are often described as a cultural and musical first in Istanbul, bringing a sound that feels both global and deeply rooted in the city's unique atmosphere.

"Dreamed at Dawn" is their debut album, released in 2017. It's a "zipped recap" of their lives in Istanbul, filled with both happiness and sorrow. The album's soundscapes are luminous, featuring the dense shimmer of guitars and the soaring falsetto of lead singer Oğuz Can Özen.

## Personal Favorites

I have a deep love for "World Horizon" and "Layers". These tracks perfectly encapsulate the band's ability to create expansive, atmospheric music that stays with you long after the last note.

### World Horizon
The way this song builds up is just incredible. It feels like a journey through a misty Istanbul morning.

### Layers
"Layers" is a pure dream pop gem. It's rhythmic, catchy, and yet hauntingly beautiful.
