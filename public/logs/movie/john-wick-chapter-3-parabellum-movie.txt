## About

**John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum (2019)** is an American neo-noir action thriller film directed by Chad Stahelski and written by Derek Kolstad, Shay Hatten, Chris Collins, and Marc Abrams. It is the third installment in the *John Wick* franchise, directly following *John Wick: Chapter 2*. The film begins with John Wick declared "excommunicado" from the High Table, with a $14 million bounty placed on his head, rendering him a target for every assassin in the world. He finds himself desperately fighting for survival in New York City, with nowhere to turn and old alliances crumbling.

Wick seeks out former allies and explores the deeper roots of the High Table's power structure, traveling to Casablanca and encountering figures from his past. The film pushes the boundaries of action choreography even further than its predecessors, incorporating diverse fighting styles and set pieces, from knife throwing in antique shops to brutal equestrian combat. It further enriches the intricate world-building of the assassin underworld, delving into its customs, history, and the relentless reach of its governing body.
