## About

**Black Bird (2022)** is an American crime drama miniseries developed by Dennis Lehane, based on the 2010 non-fiction novel *In with the Devil: A Fallen Hero, a Serial Killer, and a Dangerous Bargain for Redemption* by James Keene and Hillel Levin. The series stars Taron Egerton as James "Jimmy" Keene, a high school football hero and son of a decorated police officer, who is sentenced to 10 years in a minimum-security prison for drug dealing. He is then offered an extraordinary deal: transfer to a maximum-security prison for the criminally insane and befriend suspected serial killer Larry Hall (Paul Walter Hauser), to elicit a confession and learn the locations of his victims' bodies before Hall's appeal goes through. If successful, Jimmy walks free; if not, he remains in prison with no possibility of parole.

The series is a gripping psychological drama that delves into the dark minds of its characters and the chilling world of serial killers. It explores themes of manipulation, truth, sacrifice, and the blurred lines between good and evil. Known for its intense atmosphere and stellar performances, particularly from Egerton and Hauser, *Black Bird* offers a harrowing and unforgettable true-crime narrative.
