# My Warning Post (and what is this site about)

**Welcome to my little corner of the internet!** This isn't just a website; it's my personal playground, a digital diary where I ramble about pretty much anything that catches my fancy.
I'm _A. Samil Bulbul_, a senior software engineer by trade, but here, **I'm just me** - sharing thoughts, creations, and obsessions.

You'll find a **mixed bag** here, from deep dives into the fascinating world of computer science and engineering (think React, Go, JavaScript, and Linux wizardry)
to my unfiltered rants about **life** (_not really_), the universe, and everything in between. But it's not all serious code and existential crises! I'm also a huge fan of escaping into other worlds,
so expect plenty of reviews and musings on the latest (or classic) video games that have stolen my hours (Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, anyone?).
And when I'm not gaming, I'm probably lost in a good book, binging a captivating series like _"The Bear"_,  or grooving to some timeless tunes (_De La Soul always on rotation_).

This space is entirely my own, a place where my ideas, opinions, and sometimes questionable tastes run wild.
I share whatever I want, whenever I want, without apology. So, if you're looking for polished, perfectly curated content,
you might find some of that, but mostly, you'll find genuine, unadulterated me. Dive in, explore, and enjoy the ride!
