Yoo Se Yoon's 'Don't Skip the Interlude' (간주점프는 안돼요) is a unique musical comedy track that blends seemingly
heartfelt lyrics with an extended, humorous instrumental interlude. The song's title directly instructs listeners
not to skip this interlude, as it is central to the piece's comedic intent and overall experience.

The song features lyrics that appear serious and even heartfelt, discussing themes of love, memories,
and not wanting to waste a single second with a loved one. However, this earnestness is juxtaposed with a
deliberately long and often comically exaggerated instrumental break. In performances,
this interlude is frequently accompanied by visual gags and comedic elements, such as band members pretending to
play instruments poorly or the singer waiting impatiently for the interlude to end. Reviewers and listeners
consistently point out the song's humorous nature, particularly highlighting the unexpected and extended interlude as the
source of much laughter. Yoo Se Yoon, known as a comedian and television host, leverages his comedic background to create a
song that is both musically engaging and entertainingly funny. The humor often comes from the contrast between the serious
tone of the lyrics and the absurdity of the prolonged instrumental section, making the 'interlude' a crucial,
not-to-be-skipped, part of the song's identity.
