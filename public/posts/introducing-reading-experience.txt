Excited to unveil two brand new ways to experience content on Fezcodex Blogposts: **Dossier Mode** and **Terminal Mode!**
These unique reading modes are designed to offer a fresh and engaging perspective, allowing you to tailor your browsing experience to your personal style.

## What's New?

### 1. Dossier Mode
Step into the role of an investigator with **Dossier Mode**. This mode transforms the blogpost's interface into a sleek,
document-style layout, reminiscent of classified files and confidential reports. It's perfect for those who appreciate a clean,
minimalist aesthetic and want to immerse themselves in content without distractions, feeling like they're poring over important case files.

### 2. Terminal Mode
For the tech enthusiasts and command-line aficionados, we present **Terminal Mode**. This mode re-skins blogposts with a retro,
monospaced font, glowing green text, and a classic command-line interface feel. It's an homage to the early days of computing,
offering a nostalgic and functional environment that's ideal for developers, hackers, or anyone who enjoys a vintage digital vibe while consuming content.

## Why build this?

The goal is to continually innovate and provide diverse ways for our users to interact with our content.
I believe that offering distinct visual experiences like Dossier and Terminal modes enhances user engagement
and allows for a more personalized journey through Fezcodex.

Hope you enjoy exploring these new immersive reading modes. Happy reading!
