# go-piml

**Spec version**: v1.1.0

`go-piml` is a high-performance, production-ready Go package for marshalling and unmarshalling PIML data. It is designed to feel native to Go developers, leveraging the standard library's idioms and providing a powerful reflection-based API similar to `encoding/json`.

As the PIML specification evolves, `go-piml` serves as the reference implementation for compiled languages, ensuring that performance and type safety are never compromised.

## Core Principles

- **Developer Ergonomics**: Use standard Go struct tags (`piml:"key_name"`) to map your data structures effortlessly.
- **Strict Typing**: Seamlessly convert PIML primitives into Go's rich type system, including support for `time.Time`, custom pointers, and nested slices.
- **Performant Parsing**: The recursive descent parser is optimized for minimal allocations and high throughput.

## Struct Tagging & Mapping

PIML allows for clean separation between your code's data structures and the serialized format:

```go
type Project struct {
    ID          int      `piml:"id"`
    Title       string   `piml:"title"`
    Tags        []string `piml:"tags"`
    Released    bool     `piml:"is_released"`
    Maintenance struct {
        Active bool `piml:"active"`
    } `piml:"maintenance"`
}
```

## Advanced PIML Example

```piml
(project_registry)
  > (Project)
    (id) 101
    (title) Warp Drive Engine
    (tags)
      > physics
      > propulsion
    (is_released) true
    (maintenance)
      (active) true

(system_metrics)
  (uptime) 14500
  (load_averages)
    > 0.15
    > 0.22
    > 0.08

(description)
  Go implementation allows for deep nesting
  of structures without losing the 
  human-readable quality of the file.
```

## Go Ecosystem Integration

`go-piml` is built to fit into the Go ecosystem. Whether you are building a CLI tool that needs a readable config file, or a microservice that processes structured data, `go-piml` provides the reliability and speed expected of Go software.
