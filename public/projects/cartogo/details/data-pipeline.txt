# OpenStreetMap Data Pipeline

Fetching map data is handled by a specialized Overpass QL query engine.

## Pipeline Steps
1. **Query Building**: Dynamic BBox queries for roads, water, and greenery.
2. **Fetch & Retry**: Robust handling of API timeouts and server load.
3. **Relation Processing**: Complex multipolygon reconstruction for parks and lakes.
