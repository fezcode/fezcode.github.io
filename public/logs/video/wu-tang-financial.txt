This is one of the most iconic sketches from Dave Chappelle's legendary show. Featuring RZA and GZA, it satirizes financial services by imagining "Wu-Tang Financial."

The core message—"Diversify yo bonds"—has become a cultural touchstone. It's a perfect blend of hip-hop culture and absurdist comedy.

Rating: 5/5 - Masterpiece.
