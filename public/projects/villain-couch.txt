# Villain Couch: The VLC Tracker

![Villain Couch - Cover Art](/images/projects/villain_couch.webp)

**Villain Couch** is a silent guardian for your media consumption. It is a lightweight background agent that integrates deeply with **VLC Media Player** to track your playback progress, effectively adding a "Resume" feature to your local media library.

> "Never lose your place again. Your local media, now with cloud-level memory."

## The Problem

Streaming services remember where you left off. Local files don't.
Villain Couch solves this by acting as a sidecar to VLC, recording your progress in a local SQLite database or syncing it to a remote server.

## Key Features

*   **Silent Operation:** Runs in the background with minimal resource footprint.
*   **Auto-Resume:** Automatically detects the file you're playing and saves your timestamp.
*   **Season Intelligence:** Smart enough to detect "next episode" patterns in filenames.
*   **Cross-Session Persistence:** Close VLC, reboot your PC, open the file a week later—it resumes.

## Architecture

Built with performance and reliability in mind:

*   **Core:** Written in **Go** for native performance and zero dependencies.
*   **Integration:** Communicates with VLC via its HTTP interface.
*   **Storage:** Uses **SQLite** for robust, local data storage.
*   **Interface:** A CLI-first approach for easy scripting and automation.

## Quick Start

### Installation
Villain Couch is a single binary. No complex setup required.

```powershell
# Build from source
go build -o villain-couch ./src
```

### Usage
Simply point it to your media, or let it watch your VLC process.

```bash
./villain-couch --file "D:/Movies/The Matrix.mkv"
```

## Directory Structure

*   `agent/`: The brain of the operation. Handles VLC communication.
*   `common/`: Shared utilities for logging and config parsing.
*   `bin/`: Where the magic happens (compiled binaries).
