        The <strong className="text-current">Socratic Method</strong> (or
        Elenchus) is a form of cooperative argumentative dialogue between
        individuals, based on asking and answering questions to stimulate
        critical thinking and to draw out ideas and underlying presumptions.

        It is a dialectical method, involving a discussion in which the defense
        of one point of view is questioned; one participant may lead another to
        contradict themselves in some way, thus weakening the defender's point.
