# PIML: Parenthesis Intended Markup Language

![piml - Cover Art](/images/projects/piml.webp)

**PIML** is a data serialization format designed for humans first, machines second. It bridges the gap between the strictness of JSON and the ambiguity of YAML, offering a syntax that is readable, writable, and structurally obvious.

> "Data should be beautiful. Structure should be self-evident."

## Why PIML?

In a world of configuration hell, PIML offers a sanctuary of clarity.
*   **No Quotes:** Keys and simple strings don't need them.
*   **No Trailing Commas:** End of line means end of value.
*   **Explicit Structure:** Parentheses `(key)` clearly denote fields, preventing the "whitespace anxiety" of YAML.

## Syntax Showcase

Compare the elegance of PIML against traditional formats:

### PIML
```piml
(server)
  (host) localhost
  (port) 8080
  (ssl) true
  (endpoints)
    > /api/v1
    > /health
```

### JSON
```json
{
  "server": {
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 8080,
    "ssl": true,
    "endpoints": [
      "/api/v1",
      "/health"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Ecosystem & Tools

PIML is supported by a growing ecosystem of tools:

*   **[go-piml](/projects/go-piml):** A high-performance Go parser and serializer.
*   **[piml.js](/projects/piml.js):** Full support for JavaScript/TypeScript environments.
*   **[VS Code Extension](/projects/piml-highlighter):** Syntax highlighting and snippets for visual clarity.
*   **[PIML Lab](/apps/piml-lab):** A live playground to test and convert your data.

## Specification Highlights

*   **Null Safety:** `nil` handles nulls, empty lists, and empty objects gracefully.
*   **Lists:** Denoted by `>` for clear, vertical scanning.
*   **Comments:** Native `#` support for documenting your configuration.
*   **Multi-line Strings:** Indentation-based text blocks without escape character madness.

## Get Started

Adopt PIML for your next configuration file or data exchange format.
