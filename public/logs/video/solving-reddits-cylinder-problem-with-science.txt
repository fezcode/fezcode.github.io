## The Reddit Question

[The Thread](https://reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/zdv5gv/how_would_you_get_a_small_cylinder_51in_length/)

Imagine a man who tells everyone he has a **"small object"** (a cylinder) stuck inside a **tiny plastic tube** (a Mini M&Ms container). He says he filled the
tube with butter and mashed bananas first, and now the cylinder won't come out.

**The catch**: He **insists** that the cylinder is just an object, but everyone reading knows he’s actually talking about his... _well_, **his private parts**.

Whenever people suggest cutting the tube with a saw or using heat, he gets very panicked and says, "It is imperative that the cylinder remains
unharmed."

The ELI5 Lesson:
 1. Don't put your "cylinder" in candy containers.
 2. If you do, don't use mashed bananas as a lubricant.
 3. Don't go to the internet for medical advice while pretending your body part is a **"math shape."**

It became one of the most famous jokes on Reddit because of how committed he was to the lie that it was just a "cylinder," even when it was obvious
he was in a very painful and embarrassing emergency.
