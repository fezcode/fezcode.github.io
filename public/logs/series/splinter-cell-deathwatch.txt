# Splinter Cell: Deathwatch

An animated adaptation of the classic stealth-action video game franchise. It brings Sam Fisher back into the fold.

While it's great to see Sam Fisher again, the series struggles to capture the full tension and tactical depth of the games, settling for a more standard action-cartoon vibe.
