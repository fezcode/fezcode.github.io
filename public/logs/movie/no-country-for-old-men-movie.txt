## About

**No Country for Old Men (2007)** is an American neo-western thriller film written and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen, based on Cormac McCarthy's 2005 novel of the same name. Set in 1980 rural West Texas, the story follows Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), a hunter who stumbles upon the aftermath of a drug deal gone wrong in the desert. He finds a briefcase containing two million dollars, which he takes, inadvertently triggering a relentless and terrifying pursuit by Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), a psychopathic killer with a distinctive captive bolt pistol.

As Moss attempts to evade Chigurh, Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), a weary and philosophical lawman, tries to protect Moss and understand the escalating violence that seems to be beyond his comprehension. The film is critically acclaimed for its masterful direction, minimalist dialogue, intense atmosphere, and its unflinching, existential exploration of violence, fate, and the changing nature of good and evil in a modernizing world. It won four Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director for the Coen Brothers, Best Supporting Actor for Javier Bardem, and Best Adapted Screenplay.
