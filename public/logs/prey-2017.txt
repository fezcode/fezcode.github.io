## About

**Prey (2017)** is a first-person shooter action role-playing game developed by Arkane Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks. Released in May 2017, it is a psychological sci-fi thriller set aboard the Talos I space station, a marvel of corporate ingenuity orbiting the Moon. The game is not a sequel to the 2006 *Prey* but a spiritual successor to "immersive sim" games like *System Shock* and *BioShock*.

Players assume the role of Morgan Yu, a scientist who awakens on Talos I only to discover that the station has been overrun by a hostile alien entity known as the Typhon. The Typhon can mimic inanimate objects, leading to constant paranoia and jump scares. Morgan must navigate the increasingly dangerous station, uncover the truth behind the experiment that went horribly wrong, and decide the fate of humanity.

Gameplay in *Prey* emphasizes player choice and emergent gameplay. Players can approach challenges in multiple ways, utilizing a vast array of weapons, unique Typhon-based alien abilities (neuromods), and human skills. The game features a non-linear open-world-like design within the space station, allowing for extensive exploration, backtracking, and discovery of hidden secrets and alternate paths. Resource management, environmental interaction, and psychological horror are core tenets of the experience, complemented by a compelling narrative and multiple endings that reflect the player's moral choices.

## My Thoughts

*Prey (2017)* is a masterclass in immersive simulation, perfectly blending elements of sci-fi horror, RPG, and intricate level design into an unforgettable experience. Arkane Studios delivered a game that constantly challenged my perceptions and rewarded exploration and creative problem-solving. The atmosphere aboard Talos I is thick with tension and paranoia; every coffee cup could be a mimic, turning mundane objects into potential threats. This constant uncertainty keeps you on edge throughout.

The freedom of approach is truly remarkable. Whether I wanted to go in guns blazing, sneak past enemies using stealth, or creatively manipulate the environment and my powers to bypass obstacles, *Prey* always offered viable options. The neuromod system, granting both human and alien abilities, allows for deep character customization and truly impactful gameplay choices. Do you embrace the Typhon powers and risk becoming more alien than human, or stick to human ingenuity? These decisions resonate throughout the narrative.

The storytelling is equally compelling, unfolding through environmental clues, audio logs, and character interactions that paint a bleak but fascinating picture of scientific hubris and existential dread. The multiple endings provide genuine replayability and a satisfying conclusion to Morgan Yu's journey, making you reflect on the choices made. *Prey (2017)* is a hidden gem that deserves far more recognition—a deeply intelligent, atmospheric, and rewarding game that stands tall among the best in its genre.
