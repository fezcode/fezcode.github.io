# "Weird Al" Yankovic - White & Nerdy

"White & Nerdy" is the lead single from Weird Al Yankovic's twelfth studio album, *Straight Outta Lynwood*. It parodies Chamillionaire's "Ridin'", but instead of street life, it celebrates the intricacies and stereotypes of nerd culture.

The music video is legendary, featuring cameos like Seth Green and Donny Osmond. From editing Wikipedia to mastering Minesweeper, the lyrics cover every facet of geekdom with incredible precision and humor. It remains one of Al's most successful and recognizable tracks.

Rating: 5/5 - Masterpiece.
