## About

**Deus Ex: Mankind Divided** is a cyberpunk action role-playing game developed by Eidos Montréal and published by Square Enix. Released in 2016, it is a direct sequel to the critically acclaimed *Deus Ex: Human Revolution*.

Set in 2029, two years after the events of *Human Revolution*, the game continues the story of **Adam Jensen**, an augmented covert operative. The world is in a state of "mechanical apartheid," where mechanically augmented humans are segregated and feared by the un-augmented population following the "Aug Incident" – an event that saw augmented individuals lose control and attack others. Jensen, now working with an international task force (Task Force 29) to combat augmented terrorist groups, secretly also works with a hacker collective (Juggernaut Collective) to expose the Illuminati, the shadowy organization manipulating world events.

The game is renowned for its **blend of stealth, combat, and RPG elements**, offering players extensive freedom in how they approach missions. Players can choose to engage in direct, lethal combat, or opt for a non-lethal, stealthy approach, using Jensen's array of augmentations to their advantage. These augmentations range from cloaking devices and remote hacking tools to combat enhancements like the Titan shield and various weapon modifications. The narrative explores themes of transhumanism, prejudice, corporate conspiracy, and social inequality in a richly detailed dystopian future.

Despite some criticism regarding its ending and pacing, *Mankind Divided* is praised for its immersive atmosphere, intricate level design, choice-driven gameplay, and compelling world-building that delves deep into the ethical dilemmas of human augmentation.
