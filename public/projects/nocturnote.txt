Nocturnote is a sleek, modern, and highly customizable note-taking application designed for the minimalists who crave power. Built with the robustness of **Electron** and the agility of **Svelte**, it bridges the gap between a simple scratchpad and a full-fledged editor.

> "A distraction-free writing environment that adapts to your state of flow, not the other way around."

## Core Philosophy

Nocturnote was born from a frustration with bloated text editors. It focuses on:
*   **Immediacy:** Opens instantly.
*   **Clarity:** UI that recedes when you're typing.
*   **Flexibility:** From a retro "Notepad" aesthetic to a cyberpunk "Rain Mode".

## Key Features

*   **Customizable Typography:** Fine-tune your font family, size, weight, and line height to match your reading preferences.
*   **Seamless File Management:** Native support for `.txt` and `.md` files with auto-save capabilities.
*   **Advanced Search:** Regex-powered search and replace for power users.
*   **Visual Modes:** Switch between a classic light aesthetic or the immersive dark mode with digital rain effects.
*   **Information Bar:** Real-time stats on line/column position, character count, and file encoding.

## Architecture & Tech Stack

Nocturnote leverages a modern stack to ensure performance and cross-platform compatibility:

*   **Electron:** Provides the native desktop shell.
*   **Svelte:** Delivers a reactive, DOM-efficient UI without the virtual DOM overhead.
*   **TypeScript:** Ensures code reliability and maintainability.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** Enables rapid styling and theming.
*   **Electron-Vite:** A blazing fast build tool optimized for Electron development.
