## My Notes

I watched Relay. I liked [Lily James](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4141252/)'s character.
The plot twist was handled well. The New York vibe in the movie was fantastic.
It's a vibe movie. The music was awesome. Cinematographically, it has one of the best uses of color palettes.
[Riz Ahmed](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1981893) as always is **meh**. I really don't know if he is the most terrible or the greatest
actor of all time. It is hard to hate him or love him. Great movie nonetheless.
