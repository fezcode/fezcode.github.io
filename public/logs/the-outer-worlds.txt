## About

**The Outer Worlds** is a single-player action role-playing game developed by Obsidian Entertainment and published by Private Division. Released in October 2019, it is a new sci-fi RPG from the original creators of *Fallout* and *Fallout: New Vegas*. The game is set in an alternate future where mega-corporations have begun colonizing and terraforming planets, with the Halcyon colony being its primary setting.

Players awaken decades after being lost in transit while on a colonist ship bound for the Halcyon colony, only to find themselves embroiled in a deep conspiracy that threatens to destroy the colony. Guided by the rogue scientist Phineas Welles, players recruit a crew of companions and explore various planets and space stations, encountering diverse factions and making choices that will determine the fate of Halcyon.

Gameplay in *The Outer Worlds* features first-person combat with a variety of melee and ranged weapons, often augmented with scientific modifications. It includes a robust dialogue system with multiple choice options and skill checks, allowing players to resolve situations through combat, stealth, or persuasion. The character progression system is skill-based, with "Flaws" (optional permanent debuffs that grant bonus perk points) adding a unique layer of customization. The game is known for its darkly humorous tone, satirical critique of capitalism, and emphasis on player agency, with decisions having far-reaching consequences across the Halcyon colony.

## My Thoughts

*The Outer Worlds* is a brilliant return to form for Obsidian Entertainment, delivering a smart, witty, and deeply engaging RPG experience. From the moment I stepped onto the first planet, I was captivated by its vibrant, retro-futuristic aesthetic and its sharp, satirical take on corporate dystopias. The writing is top-notch, with genuinely funny dialogue and memorable characters who are all delightfully flawed.

What truly stands out is the game's emphasis on player choice and consequence. Almost every quest offers multiple ways to approach it, and your decisions genuinely impact the story and the world around you. You can talk your way out of sticky situations, sneak past enemies, or blast your way through, and each path feels equally valid and rewarding. The "Flaw" system is a stroke of genius, encouraging unique character builds and adding replayability by forcing you to adapt to your character's weaknesses.

The companions are a highlight, each with their own compelling backstories, distinct personalities, and loyalty quests that are as engaging as the main storyline. Their banter and reactions to your choices add immense depth and charm to the journey. While some might find the combat straightforward, it's perfectly serviceable and supports the excellent narrative and role-playing elements. *The Outer Worlds* is a must-play for fans of classic RPGs and anyone looking for a well-crafted adventure with a biting sense of humor and meaningful choices. It's a game that makes you think, laugh, and truly feel like your actions matter in a universe dominated by corporate greed.
