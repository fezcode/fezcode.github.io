The easiest way to understand the difference is to think about music:

- **The Typeface** is the **song** itself (the melody, the lyrics, the creative idea).
- **The Font** is the **MP3 file** (the actual digital file you use to play the music).

In design terms:

- **Typeface**: The specific design or look of the letters (what you see).
- **Font**: The computer file or mechanism that contains the letters (what you use).

## In Practice
You choose a **Typeface**, but you install a **Font**.

## Examples
#### 1. Helvetica

 - Typeface: "Helvetica" (The entire family of letters).
 - Font: `Helvetica-Bold.otf` (The specific file for the bold version).

#### 2. Times New Roman

 - Typeface: "Times New Roman" (The creative design).
 - Font: `Times New Roman, Italic, 12 point` (The specific variation you are using on the page).

## Summary

If you are talking to a designer about the look, you are talking about a **Typeface**.
If you are talking to a developer about the file or the bold setting, you are talking about a **Font**.
