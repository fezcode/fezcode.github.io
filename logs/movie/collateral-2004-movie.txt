## About

**Collateral (2004)** is an American neo-noir action thriller film directed by Michael Mann and written by Stuart Beattie. The film stars Tom Cruise as Vincent, a meticulous and ruthless contract killer, and Jamie Foxx as Max Durocher, a mild-mannered Los Angeles taxi driver. On one fateful night, Max's ordinary shift turns into a nightmare when Vincent forces him to drive him around the city to complete a series of five assassination targets before dawn.

As the night progresses, Max finds himself increasingly entangled in Vincent's deadly world, forced to confront his own fears and limitations. The film is renowned for its intense, character-driven narrative, its stylish and atmospheric portrayal of the Los Angeles cityscape at night (often shot on digital video to capture its unique look), and its exploration of themes like chance, fate, and the unexpected connections between strangers. It features powerful performances from its lead actors, with Cruise delivering a chillingly effective villain and Foxx earning an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor.
