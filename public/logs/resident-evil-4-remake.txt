## About

**Resident Evil 4: Remake** is a survival horror game developed and published by Capcom. Released in March 2023, it is a faithful yet reimagined version of the critically acclaimed 2005 original, *Resident Evil 4*. The remake modernizes the classic experience with updated graphics, refined gameplay mechanics, and expanded storytelling while preserving the core essence that made the original a masterpiece.

The game follows U.S. agent Leon S. Kennedy as he is sent on a mission to rescue Ashley Graham, the U.S. President's daughter, who has been kidnapped by a mysterious cult in a rural part of Spain. Leon soon discovers that the locals, infected by a parasitic organism known as Las Plagas, have been transformed into violent, mind-controlled creatures. Unlike the zombie-infested Raccoon City, these enemies are intelligent and aggressive, leading to intense and dynamic combat encounters.

The remake features over-the-shoulder third-person gameplay, emphasizing precise aiming, strategic resource management, and close-quarters combat. New mechanics, such as the ability to parry enemy attacks with Leon's knife and expanded stealth options, add layers of depth to the gameplay. The story is retold with a darker, more serious tone, enriching character interactions and expanding on certain plot points, while still delivering the iconic moments and memorable boss fights that fans cherish.
