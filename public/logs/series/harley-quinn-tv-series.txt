## About

**Harley Quinn (2019)** is an American adult animated superhero comedy television series based on the DC Comics character of the same name. Developed by Justin Halpern, Patrick Schumacker, and Dean Lorey, the series follows the misadventures of Harley Quinn after she finally breaks up with the Joker and attempts to strike out on her own. With the help of Poison Ivy and a diverse crew of DC outcasts, Harley aims to become a member of the Legion of Doom and establish herself as a formidable villain in Gotham City.

The series is widely praised for its sharp, irreverent humor, meta-commentary on the superhero genre, and its surprisingly deep exploration of Harley's growth and her relationships, particularly her bond with Poison Ivy. Featuring a stellar voice cast led by Kaley Cuoco, *Harley Quinn* offers a fresh, vibrant, and R-rated take on the DC Universe, blending chaotic action with genuine heart and character-driven storytelling.
