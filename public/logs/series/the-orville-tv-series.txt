## About

**The Orville (2017)** is an American science fiction comedy-drama television series created by and starring Seth MacFarlane. Set 400 years in the future, the series follows the adventures of the USS Orville, a mid-level exploratory vessel in Earth's Planetary Union fleet. Captain Ed Mercer (MacFarlane) and his first officer, Kelly Grayson (Adrianne Palicki), who is also his ex-wife, lead a diverse human and alien crew as they navigate the wonders and dangers of deep space.

The show is a loving homage to classic Star Trek, particularly *The Next Generation*, blending episodic adventure with thoughtful exploration of contemporary social issues, philosophical dilemmas, and ethical questions. While it often employs humor, *The Orville* tackles serious themes with sincerity and depth, using its sci-fi setting to comment on identity, prejudice, religion, artificial intelligence, and more. It balances its comedic elements with genuine dramatic stakes and character development.
