SUBTEXT: The Grammar

In a world of configuration hell, PIML offers a sanctuary of clarity. Our architecture prioritizes human vertical scanning and structural clarity over machine-centric verbosity.

- **No Quotes**: Keys and simple strings don't need them.
- **No Trailing Commas**: End of line means end of value.
- **Explicit Structure**: Parentheses (key) clearly denote fields.
- **Lists**: Denoted by > for clear, vertical scanning.
- **Comments**: Native # support.
- **Multi-line Strings**: Indentation-based text blocks.

PIML is designed to be the "Anti-JSON" — removing the noise and keeping the signal. It's not just a format; it's a way of organizing thought.
