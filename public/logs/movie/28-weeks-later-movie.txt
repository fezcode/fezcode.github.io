## About

**28 Weeks Later (2007)** is a British post-apocalyptic horror film directed by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo. It is a direct sequel to Danny Boyle's *28 Days Later*. The film picks up 28 weeks after the initial Rage virus outbreak that devastated Great Britain. With the infected presumed to have starved to death, NATO forces establish a safe zone in London, attempting to rebuild civilization and repatriate survivors. However, the fragile peace is shattered when two children, Don and Tammy, return to find their parents, leading to a catastrophic reintroduction of the virus and a renewed struggle for survival.

The film is known for its relentless pace, intense action sequences, and bleak, unflinching depiction of a society collapsing under the weight of fear and biological threat. It explores themes of military failure, family breakdown, and the dark side of human nature when pushed to its limits, often presenting a more terrifying villain in human actions than in the infected themselves.
