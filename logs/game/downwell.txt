# Downwell

Downwell is a masterclass in minimalist game design. Developed by Moppin and published by Devolver Digital, it task you with one simple goal: fall as deep as you can.

## Gunboots and Gravity
The core of the game is your "Gunboots". They serve as both your primary weapon and your primary means of controlling your descent. Firing downwards kills enemies and provides a slight hover, allowing you to chain together combos without touching the ground. The deeper you go, the more complex the enemies and environments become, but the mechanics remain elegantly simple.

## Aesthetic and Style
The game uses a striking three-color palette (initially black, white, and red), which you can customize by unlocking different color palettes as you play. This minimalist approach ensures that the high-speed action remains readable even when the screen is filled with enemies and projectiles.

Downwell is a perfect example of how a few well-executed mechanics can create a deeply satisfying and addictive gameplay loop. It's a "just one more run" kind of game that respects your time while providing a significant challenge.
