## About

**Loop Hero** is a roguelike deck-building game developed by Four Quarters and published by Devolver Digital. Released in March 2021, it quickly garnered critical acclaim for its innovative gameplay loop, minimalist pixel art style, and surprisingly deep strategic elements.

In *Loop Hero*, players do not directly control the hero. Instead, the hero automatically walks along a looping path, fighting monsters and gathering resources. The core gameplay revolves around strategically placing cards (representing terrain, enemies, and buildings) onto the looping path and its surroundings. These cards alter the environment, spawn different types of monsters, and provide various benefits or challenges to the hero. The goal is to build an increasingly powerful world around the hero, defeat bosses, and gather resources to upgrade the camp, which provides permanent buffs for future expeditions.

The narrative is minimalistic and unfolds through cryptic lore snippets and character dialogues. The world has been plunged into a chaotic void by the Lich, and the hero is tasked with rebuilding it from memory. Each "loop" and card placement contributes to piecing together the forgotten world. The game masterfully blends elements of roguelike progression, deck-building, and idle game mechanics, creating a unique and highly addictive experience.
