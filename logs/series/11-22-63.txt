## Extensive Trivia & Facts

1. **The Origin:** Stephen King first conceived the idea for *11/22/63* in 1971, before his first novel *Carrie* was even published. He initially abandoned it because it required more research than he was prepared for at the time.
2. **James Franco's Passion:** Franco was a huge fan of the book and initially wanted to option the rights himself, but J.J. Abrams had already beaten him to it. Franco wrote an essay about the book for *Vice*, which led Abrams to offer him the lead role.
3. **The Director's Chair:** James Franco directed the fifth episode of the series, titled "The Truth."
4. **Historical Location:** The production was granted permission to film at Dealey Plaza in Dallas, the actual site of the Kennedy assassination. They had to close down several blocks of downtown Dallas to recreate the 1963 motorcade.
5. **Authentic Vehicles:** The 1961 Lincoln Continental limousine used in the motorcade scenes was a meticulously crafted replica, but many of the other cars in the background were authentic period vehicles sourced from collectors.
6. **Stephen King's Influence:** Stephen King's background as a high school English teacher heavily influenced the protagonist's profession in the novel and series. King himself taught English in Maine.
7. **Easter Eggs:** The series contains several nods to King's other works. The "Yellow Card Man" is a recurring enigma. There's a reference to *The Shining* with the vibe of "REDRUM" and subtle references to Derry, Maine (the setting of *IT*).
8. **The Rabbit Hole:** The portal to the past is located in a diner's pantry. In the book, the "rabbit hole" always leads to September 9, 1958, at 11:58 AM. In the series, it was changed to October 21, 1960, to shorten the timeline for a TV adaptation.
9. **Lee Harvey Oswald's Voice:** Daniel Webber, who played Oswald, listened to recordings of Oswald's voice for hours to perfect the specific accent and cadence.
10. **The Yellow Card:** The Yellow Card Man is a guardian of the time portal. In the book, the card's color changes based on the stability of the timeline (Green, Yellow, Orange, Black). In the show, the concept is simplified but still mysterious.
11. **Production Team:** Produced by J.J. Abrams' Bad Robot Productions, the series shows his signature blend of mystery and high production value.
12. **The Ending:** Stephen King originally had a different ending for the novel. His son, Joe Hill, suggested the ending that was ultimately published, which the TV series also largely follows.
13. **Real-Life Locations:** Besides Dealey Plaza, several scenes were filmed in Hamilton, Ontario, which doubled for many of the period locations.
14. **Alex Heffes' Score:** The composer Alex Heffes mixed period-appropriate sounds with a modern thriller score to bridge the gap between the 1960s setting and the modern sensibilities of the show.
