# Philosophy 101: Logic - The Toolbox

## The Architect's Tools

Before we can build a worldview, we need tools. In philosophy, our hammer and saw are **Logic**.

You can have the most beautiful, poetic thoughts in the world, but if your logic is flawed, your philosophy is just poetry (no offense to poets).

## What is an Argument?

In philosophy, an argument isn't a shouting match. It's a set of statements (premises) intended to determine the degree of truth of another statement (the conclusion).

**The Standard Form:**

1.  **Premise 1:** All humans are mortal.
2.  **Premise 2:** Socrates is a human.
3.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, Socrates is mortal.

## Validity vs. Soundness

This is where 90% of internet debates fail.

*   **Validity:** If the premises are true, the conclusion *must* be true. The *structure* is correct.
*   **Soundness:** The argument is valid *AND* the premises are actually true.

**Example of a VALID but UNSOUND argument:**
1.  All toasters are time machines. (False premise)
2.  This object is a toaster. (True premise)
3.  Therefore, this object is a time machine. (Valid logic, but garbage conclusion because Premise 1 is false).

## Deduction vs. Induction

*   **Deductive:** Top-down. If premises are true, the conclusion is **certain** (like the Socrates example).
*   **Inductive:** Bottom-up. Observation to pattern. The conclusion is **probable**, not certain. (e.g., "The sun has risen every day of my life, therefore it will rise tomorrow." High probability, but not logically guaranteed by the premises alone).

## Recommended Resources

**1. The Website:**
[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy (IEP) - Logic](https://iep.utm.edu/)
*   Generally more accessible than the SEP for beginners.

**2. The Book:**
*   **"A Rulebook for Arguments" by Anthony Weston**.
*   It's short, cheap, and essential. It breaks down how to write and assess arguments without 500 pages of theory.

Next time, we ask: **How do we know anything at all?** (Epistemology).
