## About

**Blade (1998)** is an American superhero horror film based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. Directed by Stephen Norrington and written by David S. Goyer, the film stars Wesley Snipes as Eric Brooks, also known as Blade – a half-human, half-vampire "Daywalker." Blessed with all of a vampire's strengths but none of their weaknesses (save for the thirst for blood, which he suppresses with a serum), Blade dedicates his life to hunting vampires and protecting humanity from their hidden world.

The film primarily focuses on Blade's battle against Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff), a charismatic and ambitious young vampire who seeks to awaken an ancient blood god to bring about a vampire apocalypse. *Blade* is notable for its dark, gritty tone, stylish action sequences (especially its martial arts choreography), and its unique blend of superhero and horror genres. It was a commercial success and is often credited with paving the way for the modern wave of successful superhero films by demonstrating that comic book adaptations could appeal to adult audiences.
