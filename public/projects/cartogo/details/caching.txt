# High-Speed Binary Caching

Sub-second re-renders are achieved through a binary caching system using Go's `gob` format.

## Optimization
- **Binary Serialization**: Near-instant disk I/O compared to JSON or XML.
- **Nominatim Cache**: Stores geocoding results locally to respect rate limits.
- **Data Persistence**: Map data remains cached for future artistic iterations.
