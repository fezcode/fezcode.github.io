# Madvillainy - Madvillain (MF DOOM & Madlib)

Released in 2004 on Stones Throw Records, *Madvillainy* is widely regarded as one of the greatest hip-hop albums of all time. It is the only studio album from the duo Madvillain, consisting of rapper MF DOOM and producer Madlib.

## The Supervillain: MF DOOM

Daniel Dumile, the man behind the mask, had a life marked by tragedy and rebirth. 

- **Early Days:** He started his career as Zev Love X in the group KMD.
- **Tragedy:** In 1993, his brother and groupmate DJ Subroc was killed in a car accident. Shortly after, their label dropped them, and Dumile vanished from the scene.
- **The Mask:** He re-emerged in the late 90s, performing at open-mic nights with a stocking over his head, eventually adopting the iconic metal mask inspired by Doctor Doom. He wanted the focus to be on the music, not the artist's appearance.
- **Legacy:** Known for his incredible wordplay, internal rhymes, and "villainous" persona, DOOM became a hero to the underground. He passed away in October 2020, leaving behind a peerless discography.

## Album Trivia

- **Minimalist Production:** Madlib produced most of the album in Brazil using very basic equipment: a Boss SP-303 sampler, a portable turntable, and a cassette deck. He often worked from his hotel room.
- **The Infamous Leak:** An unfinished version of the album was leaked in 2002. This frustrated the duo so much that they stopped working on it for a while. 
- **The Vocal Shift:** Because of the leak, DOOM decided to re-record his vocals. He shifted from a more energetic delivery to the "slower, more relaxed flow" that became the album's signature.
- **No Hooks:** Most of the 22 tracks are under three minutes long and lack traditional hooks or choruses. It plays more like a series of vivid, gritty vignettes.
- **The Cover Art:** The grayscale cover was designed by Jeff Jank. The small orange square in the top right corner was a deliberate nod to Madonna's debut album cover.
- **Accordion Secrets:** In the track "Accordion," the main sample is actually an electric chord organ, not an accordion.
- **Stacy Epps:** The only non-rap feature is Stacy Epps on "Eye." Interestingly, she later became a lawyer and represented both Madlib and DOOM's estates.

*Madvillainy* remains a testament to what is possible when two creative geniuses are allowed to experiment without boundaries. It is complex, funny, dark, and eternally fresh.
