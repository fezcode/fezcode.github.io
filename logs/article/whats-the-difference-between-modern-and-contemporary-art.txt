Modern art, spanning roughly from the 1860s to the late 1960s, broke from traditional art forms by focusing on the medium
itself and depicting modern life, as seen in movements like Impressionism and Cubism. Contemporary art, emerging from the late 1960s or 1970s,
distinguishes itself by prioritizing the concept behind the artwork over aesthetic beauty, often involving audience participation and emphasizing the artistic process.
