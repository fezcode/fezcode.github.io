## About

**Resident Evil 3: Remake** is a survival horror game developed and published by Capcom. Released in April 2020, it is a reimagining of the 1999 PlayStation classic, *Resident Evil 3: Nemesis*. The remake modernizes the game with contemporary graphics and controls, while narrating the harrowing escape of Jill Valentine from Raccoon City during a zombie apocalypse, all while being relentlessly pursued by the unstoppable bio-organic weapon, Nemesis.

The story runs concurrently with *Resident Evil 2*, focusing on S.T.A.R.S. operative Jill Valentine's desperate struggle to survive in a city overrun by the T-virus. Her primary antagonist is Nemesis, a highly intelligent and resilient creature designed by Umbrella Corporation to eliminate surviving S.T.A.R.S. members. The game emphasizes action over strict survival horror, featuring more combat encounters and a faster pace than its predecessor.

Gameplay mechanics include the over-the-shoulder third-person perspective seen in *Resident Evil 2 Remake*, with refined gunplay and movement. A new "perfect dodge" mechanic allows players to evade enemy attacks with precise timing, rewarding them with an opportunity to counter-attack. The game also features environmental destructibility and dynamic encounters with Nemesis, ensuring constant pressure and unpredictability. While it generally received positive reviews for its graphics and gameplay, some criticism was directed at its shorter campaign and linearity compared to the original.
