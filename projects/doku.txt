Doku.js is a terminal UI text/document viewer that supports a custom documentation syntax called `doky`.

## Features:

*   **Customizable Display:** Border colors, centered content, frame positioning, and text sliding.
*   **Pattern Transformation:** Automatically converts common text patterns into more visually appealing characters (e.g., `---` to `▔`, `==>` to `⇒`).
*   **Text Search:** Built-in functionality for searching within documents.
*   **App Commands:** Interactive commands for navigation (next/previous line/page), jumping to specific lines, cycling border colors, centering content, toggling text slide, and more.
*   **Command Line Interface:** Provides a command line within the application for advanced actions like `switch`, `toggle`, `find`, and `time` settings.
*   **Events:** Supports `doku-start` and `doku-end` events for integration into other Node.js applications.
*   **Parsing:** Efficiently parses plain text files, adapting to terminal size changes.

## Installation:

Install globally via npm: `npm install -g doku.js`. Can also be used locally with `npx doku` or integrated as a dependency in Node.js projects.

## Doky - Custom Documentation Syntax:

`doky` allows for custom commands to control terminal display, including:

*   **Tables:** Define tabular data with `@{begin-table}@` and `@{end-table}@` commands.
*   **Code Blocks:** Display inline or multiline code using triple backticks (```).
*   **Coloring:** Extensive commands for foreground, background, and text effects (e.g., `c.fg.red`, `c.bg.blue`, `c.underscore`).
*   **Extras:** Commands like `shrug` (¯\\_(ツ)_/¯) and `startdate`.
*   **Escaping:** Mechanism to escape commands for literal display.
