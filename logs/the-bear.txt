## My Thoughts

This show is absolutely brilliant. The pacing, the character development, and the raw intensity of the kitchen environment are all top-notch. It's a must-watch for anyone who appreciates great storytelling.

> That episode... "Fishes". It hit me hard. The raw sadness, the sheer depression of it all. I don't think I can ever watch it again, oh my lord. Yet, it laid bare so much, explaining the tangled mess of everything. And the acting? Absolutely beautiful, truly captivating. God damn.
