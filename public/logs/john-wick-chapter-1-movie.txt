## About

**John Wick: Chapter 1 (2014)** is an American neo-noir action thriller film directed by Chad Stahelski (and uncredited David Leitch) and written by Derek Kolstad. The film stars Keanu Reeves as the titular character, John Wick, a legendary hitman who had retired from the criminal underworld after falling in love. His brief peace is shattered when his car is stolen and his puppy, a final gift from his recently deceased wife, is killed by Russian mobsters.

This act of senseless violence reignites the dormant killer within Wick, sending him on a brutal quest for revenge through a hyper-stylized, secret world of assassins, complete with its own rules, currency, and safe havens. The film is celebrated for its meticulously choreographed "gun-fu" action sequences, sleek visual aesthetic, minimalist yet effective storytelling, and its rich, immersive world-building that hinted at a much larger, intricate criminal society beneath the surface. It was a critical and commercial success, spawning a highly popular franchise.
