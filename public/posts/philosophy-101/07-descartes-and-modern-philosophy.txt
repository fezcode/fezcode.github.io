# Philosophy 101: René Descartes - The Father of Modern Philosophy

## The Reset Button

For centuries, philosophy was dominated by Aristotle and the Church. Then came René Descartes (1596–1650), a French mathematician and scientist who decided to burn the whole house down and start over.

He famously locked himself in a room with a stove and decided to doubt *everything* that could possibly be doubted.

## The Method of Doubt

Descartes asked: "What can I know for certain?"
*   Can I trust my senses? No, they deceive me (optical illusions).
*   Can I trust reality? No, I could be dreaming (or in a Matrix).
*   Can I trust math? No, an "Evil Demon" could be tricking me into thinking 2+2=4.

## The Bedrock: Cogito, Ergo Sum

He eventually hit something he couldn't doubt.
Even if he is being deceived, *he* must exist to *be* deceived. Even if he is doubting, *he* must exist to *doubt*.

**[Cogito, ergo sum](/vocab/cogito-ergo-sum)**: "I think, therefore I am."

This single sentence shifted the focus of philosophy from "What is the world?" to "What can *I* know?" This focus on the subject (the self) is the birth of **Modern Philosophy**.

## Dualism

Descartes concluded that because he could imagine himself without a body, but not without a mind, they must be different things.
*   **Res Extensa:** Extended things (Matter, the body, physics).
*   **Res Cogitans:** Thinking things (Mind, soul, consciousness).

This created the **Mind-Body Problem** that still haunts us today (and is the root of the "Ghost in the Machine" concept).

## Why He Matters

Descartes made philosophy about **Epistemology** (Knowledge) first. He championed **Rationalism**—the idea that reason, not just observation, is the path to truth. He also invented the Cartesian coordinate system (X and Y axes), so you can thank (or blame) him for your algebra homework.

## Recommended Resources

**1. The Book:**
*   **"Meditations on First Philosophy" by René Descartes**.
*   It's actually quite short and readable. It reads like a diary of a man having an existential crisis.

Next time, we jump forward to the man who declared God dead: **Nietzsche**.
