## About

**22 Jump Street (2014)** is an American action comedy film directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, and the sequel to the 2012 film *21 Jump Street*. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum reprise their roles as undercover police officers Schmidt and Jenko. After the success of their high school assignment, they are assigned to go undercover once again, this time at a local college, to expose the supplier of a new synthetic drug called "WHYPHY."

The film famously leans into its sequel status, gleefully deconstructing and parodying sequel tropes, the buddy-cop genre, and their own relationship dynamic. It builds upon the established comedic chemistry between Hill and Tatum, delivering a film that is often cited as a rare example of a sequel surpassing its predecessor in certain aspects. It received critical acclaim for its humor, self-awareness, and the continued strong performances from its lead actors.
