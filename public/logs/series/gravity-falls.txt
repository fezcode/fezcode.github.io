## About

**Gravity Falls** is an animated mystery-comedy series created by Alex Hirsch for Disney Channel and Disney XD. The series follows the adventures of Dipper Pines (voiced by Jason Ritter) and his twin sister Mabel (voiced by Kristen Schaal) who are sent to spend their summer vacation with their great-uncle (or "Grunkle") Stan in Gravity Falls, Oregon, a mysterious town full of paranormal incidents and supernatural creatures.

The kids help Stan run "The Mystery Shack," the tourist trap he owns, while also investigating the local mysteries. This series is celebrated for its smart writing, pop culture references, complex continuity, and code-breaking elements that engage viewers beyond the screen.

## My Opinions

I really liked how the two siblings, Dipper and Mabel, were portrayed. Their relationship felt genuine and was the heart of the show. The overall charm of the series, mixing genuine mystery with humor and heart, made it a delightful watch.
