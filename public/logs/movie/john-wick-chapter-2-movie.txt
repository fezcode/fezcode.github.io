## About

**John Wick: Chapter 2 (2017)** is an American neo-noir action thriller film directed by Chad Stahelski and written by Derek Kolstad. It is the second installment in the *John Wick* franchise and a direct sequel to the 2014 film *John Wick*. Keanu Reeves returns as the titular character, legendary hitman John Wick. Shortly after reclaiming his car and finding a new dog, Wick is visited by Santino D'Antonio, a crime lord with whom he made a blood oath (a "Marker") in the past. D'Antonio demands Wick repay the debt by assassinating his sister, Gianna D'Antonio.

Forced out of his brief retirement, Wick travels to Rome, where he finds himself embroiled in a global network of assassins and the intricate rules and consequences of the High Table. The film further expands the unique mythology of the John Wick universe, introducing new characters, locations, and deepening the lore surrounding the assassin's guild. It is celebrated for escalating the already impressive action choreography from the first film, delivering more elaborate and diverse fight sequences, while maintaining its stylish visual aesthetic and minimalist storytelling.
