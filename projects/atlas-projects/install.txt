### Installation
## The recommended way to install the Atlas Suite is via **atlas.hub**:

```bash
# 1. Bootstrap the hub
git clone https://github.com/fezcode/atlas.hub
cd atlas.hub
./scripts/install.sh  # or scripts/install.ps1 on Windows
```

Once installed, simply run `atlas.hub` to interactively select and install any tool in the suite. The hub automates the cloning, building (via **gobake**), and path management for you.

To manually build for all platforms, you can still run `gobake build` in any individual tool repository.
