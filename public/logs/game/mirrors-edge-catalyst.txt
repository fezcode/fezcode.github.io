# Mirror's Edge Catalyst

Mirror's Edge Catalyst is more than just a sequel; it's a realization of the vision set forth by the original 2008 game. While the open-world structure and combat received mixed reviews at launch, the game's core elements—its atmosphere and music—are nothing short of a masterpiece.

## Atmosphere: The City of Glass

The City of Glass is a triumph of art direction. It moves away from the gritty, lived-in feel of many open-world cities, opting instead for a pristine, clinical, and minimalist aesthetic. The dominance of white, punctuated by vibrant primary colors that guide your path (the "Runner's Vision"), creates a sense of high-tech utopia that feels both beautiful and eerily oppressive.

Running across the rooftops during the transition from day to night is a transformative experience. The way the light reflects off the glass skyscrapers, combined with the sheer scale of the city below, makes you feel like a ghost in a machine.

## Music: Solar Fields' Masterwork

Magnus Birgersson, better known as Solar Fields, returned to compose the soundtrack, and he delivered what is arguably his best work. The music isn't just a background element; it's the heartbeat of the game.

The score is dynamic, shifting seamlessly between ambient, ethereal pads while you're exploring and pulsing, driving electronic beats when you're in a high-stakes chase. It perfectly captures the "flow" state that parkour requires. The main theme and tracks like "The City of Glass" are hauntingly beautiful, evoking a sense of loneliness and freedom that perfectly matches Faith's journey.

Even years after its release, I often find myself returning to the City of Glass just to run through its pristine corridors and listen to the masterful score. It remains a benchmark for how music and art direction can elevate a game into a true sensory experience.
